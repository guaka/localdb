# Comparison to Existing Projects

## Why this doc exists

[Issue #38](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/38) asked how localdb differs from tools
people already use for personal knowledge search — GPT4All's LocalDocs feature was the reporter's
own reference point. This document answers that directly: what localdb's combination of design
choices actually is, how it compares against eight adjacent projects as of 2026-07-01, where it is
behind, and where it is headed that nothing else surveyed does yet.

This is a snapshot, not a standing claim of superiority. Several of the projects below move fast;
re-check before citing a specific fact (star count, release date, feature status) more than a few
months out.

## What makes localdb's combination distinctive

localdb is a **search/retrieval primitive, not an app** — "do one thing well," in the Unix sense.
Its surface is deliberately narrow: index, search, cite. The CLI and MCP server expose four
read-only tools (`search`, `list_stores`, `get_document`, `get_chunks`); there is no note editor,
chat UI, or agent-orchestration layer built into the binary. That narrowness is a design choice, not
an omission: it keeps the retrieval API stable enough for other things to be built _on top_ of it. A
project's or agent's own Markdown knowledge base can be pointed at with `localdb source add` and
kept current with incremental re-index (unchanged content is skipped by content hash), so a
second-brain UI or an agent's own scratchpad-memory layer can search current state without owning
the indexing pipeline itself. Most of the projects surveyed below take the opposite bet: they bundle
a chat interface, a notes editor, or an agent-orchestration layer directly into the same binary as
the retrieval engine, which is a reasonable product choice but couples the retrieval API to that
layer's roadmap.

Around that core choice, several other properties combine in a way no single surveyed project
matches all at once:

- **A single, dependency-free binary.** localdb is a statically-typed Rust program: `cargo install`
  or download a tarball, and it runs. No Python interpreter, virtualenv, or `pip` resolution; no
  `node_modules`; no JVM; no Docker. This is a real, verifiable difference from most of the field
  below — Khoj, Basic Memory, PrivateGPT, and txtai are Python packages (`pip`/`uv`/venv required);
  Onyx's backend is Python and its frontend Node; AnythingLLM's stack is Node.js. Only GPT4All and
  Recoll match localdb here, and neither has hybrid search or an MCP server (see the table below).
- **No external services.** No Postgres, no vector-database server, no Redis, no Docker Compose
  stack. Contrast Onyx's genuine multi-service architecture (Postgres + OpenSearch + Redis + MinIO,
  ~13 containers via Docker Compose) or Khoj's internally-managed Postgres/pgvector process.
- **Throw (almost) anything at it.** The extraction pipeline handles Markdown, plain text, HTML, PDF
  (text-layer), Office documents (DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/XLS/CSV), and EPUB (2 & 3) — all parsed in-process
  by pure-Rust or embedded libraries, no shelling out to a converter binary or a separate Tika/JVM
  process. And this is a floor, not a ceiling: the domain model already has typed slots
  (`IngestorKind::Notion`, `Telegram`, `Signal`, `HackMd`, `Email`, `Transcription`, `Feed`)
  reserved for connectors landing next — see [specs/06-roadmap.md](../specs/06-roadmap.md) Phase 2
  and "Where localdb is headed" below.
- **Sensible defaults.** No init step required — `store add` to a working `search` is four commands:
  `store add`, `source add`, `index`, `search` (see the
  [README quickstart](../README.md#60-second-quickstart), which also shows an optional `status`
  check); the default embedding backend auto-selects CoreML on Apple Silicon and falls back to ONNX
  elsewhere; no API key is required to start.
- **Agent-first, not chat-first.** The CLI and MCP server are the primary surfaces, not a bolted-on
  integration layer. This has been validated in practice against multiple agentic clients — Codex,
  Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Hermes Agent — and across both cloud model providers (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, DeepSeek) and a local one (Gemma, via ONNX/CoreML). Most competitors' MCP stories are
  client-only (they consume external MCP tools but don't expose one) or rely on a third-party
  wrapper that has gone stale.
- **Blazingly efficient.** Binary-quantized (1-bit) embedding vectors plus a DiskANN index, and
  native CoreML (ANE/GPU) or ONNX inference — no GPU and no cloud embedding call is required.
- **Structured, verifiable citations.** Every result carries a source URI, heading path, exact byte
  span, and content hash — not just a file name and a snippet.

No project surveyed below combines all of these. Each matches localdb on some axes and diverges on
others — that comparison, not a "we win" scorecard, is the point of this document.

¹ No Python/Node/JVM interpreter or Docker required just to run the thing. ² No separately-running
Postgres/Vespa/OpenSearch/Redis/MinIO etc. for single-user use. ³ Byte-span + content-hash
citations, not just a filename-and-snippet reference.

`⚠️` = partial: AnythingLLM's desktop build is a self-contained installer but its Docker/source path
is a Node.js stack; Khoj as of 2026 can auto-start an embedded Postgres/pgvector process
(`USE_EMBEDDED_DB=true`), so no manual provisioning is needed, but it's still an internally-run
database server, not an embedded library; PrivateGPT embeds Qdrant locally but still needs an
externally-running OpenAI-compatible inference server (Ollama/vLLM/llama.cpp) for the LLM itself.

This table is deliberately narrow — five axes, chosen because they're where localdb's design differs
most from the field. It is not a completeness ranking: Onyx, for instance, ships a far larger
_connector_ library today than localdb does (see "Where localdb is behind").

## Per-project narrative

**GPT4All LocalDocs.** A desktop chat app with a "LocalDocs" plugin that lets the bundled LLM
retrieve from a folder of documents via on-device (Nomic) embeddings. It overlaps with localdb on
"compiled, self-contained, no external services" — but it's vector-only (no BM25/hybrid), has no MCP
surface at all, and citations are a file name plus snippet with no byte spans. Format support is
narrower than it first appears: only `.txt`/`.md`/`.rst` are officially supported and extensively
tested; PDF works but is explicitly flagged by the maintainers as not extensively tested, and DOCX
requires manually whitelisting the extension with no guaranteed extraction quality. Maintenance is
the bigger concern for anyone evaluating it today: no commits since 2025-05-27 (13+ months), the
last release was v3.10.0 (2025-02-25), and the project's own issue tracker has an open "Is GPT4all
dead?" thread.

**Khoj.** A self-hostable (or Docker-Compose-deployed) "AI second brain" with a much larger surface
than localdb — chat, scheduled research agents, image generation — with document search as one
feature among many. Search is vector-only (bi-encoder retrieval with a cross-encoder rerank stage),
no BM25. As of 2026 it can auto-start an embedded Postgres/pgvector process
(`USE_EMBEDDED_DB=true`), so single-user setups no longer require manually provisioning a database
server — but it's still running a full Postgres instance internally, not an embedded library the way
localdb's libsql or Basic Memory's SQLite are. Its MCP story is client-only: it can _consume_
external MCP tools inside its research mode, but does not expose its own document store as an MCP
server — a gap tracked in its own issue tracker (#1364). Khoj's hosted cloud offering was sunset
2026-04-15 as the company pivoted commercially, but the open-source project itself remains very
actively maintained (35.4k★, commits within the week), making it the most credible
actively-maintained alternative for someone who wants a bundled chat experience rather than a
retrieval primitive.

**Basic Memory.** The closest architectural peer to localdb: local-first, a native MCP server, and
hybrid full-text + vector search (FastEmbed embeddings over SQLite), installed without any external
database ("just files plus a local SQLite index, no servers required"). Two divergences matter.
First, scope and trust boundary: its MCP tool surface is read-write — an agent can create, edit,
move, and delete notes and build a knowledge graph through it — where localdb's three MCP tools are
read-only. That's a deliberate tradeoff each project makes differently, not a bug in either: Basic
Memory is a notes app that happens to be agent-editable, localdb is a retrieval layer that assumes
something else owns writes. Second, and directly relevant to
[issue #38](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/38)'s original question: **Basic Memory is
scoped strictly to Markdown.** Its source tree contains a Markdown parser
(`src/basic_memory/markdown/`) and exactly four chat-export importers (ChatGPT, Claude
conversations, Claude projects, a generic `memory.json` format) — there is no PDF, DOCX, or other
binary/office document ingestion in the codebase or its docs. localdb already ships PDF, Office
(DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/XLS/CSV), and EPUB extraction today, in-process, with connectors for richer content
(Notion, email, chat, transcription) planned next — see "Where localdb is headed" below. Citations
are note-level, without byte spans or content hashes. Actively maintained (3.3k★, releases roughly
weekly).

**AnythingLLM.** A desktop binary (self-contained installer) that can also scale into a
Node.js/Docker deployment for teams. It has genuinely broad document support — PDF, DOCX, PPTX,
XLSX, TXT, CSV, and more, all uploadable through drag-and-drop — and uses LanceDB as its default
embedded vector store, so single-user use needs no external database. Search is vector-only today; a
hybrid BM25 pull request has been open and unmerged since roughly June 2026. Its MCP support is
explicitly client-only — the project's own docs state it does not implement Resources, Prompts, or
Sampling — which is a narrower MCP story than localdb's server. Largest and fastest-growing
community of the projects surveyed (62.4k★).

**Onyx (formerly Danswer).** The most operationally heavy project in this list: a genuine
multi-service architecture — Postgres, OpenSearch, Redis, MinIO, and background workers via Docker
Compose (~13 containers) or Helm. (Onyx replaced Vespa with OpenSearch in v3.0.0 and removed it
fully by v4.x, but the multi-service shape is unchanged.) This is the sharpest contrast with
localdb's single-binary, no-external-services design — Onyx is built for team/enterprise
deployments, not a personal machine. It is open-core (community edition MIT-licensed, enterprise
features proprietary), has hybrid search backed by OpenSearch, and supports MCP on both the client
and server side. Worth calling out honestly: Onyx's _connector_ library (40+ integrations — Slack,
Confluence, Google Drive, Jira, Notion, web crawling, and more, alongside file-upload formats
including PDF and Office documents) is far more mature than localdb's today, where only local files
and URLs are indexed. Actively maintained (30.6k★).

**PrivateGPT (zylon-ai).** Positions itself as a self-hosted API layer in front of local model
runtimes (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp) with RAG built in, installed via Homebrew or a pinned
`uv tool install`. Qdrant runs embedded locally (no separate vector-DB server), but the LLM itself
must come from an externally-running inference server — so it isn't fully self-contained end-to-end
the way localdb is. Went through roughly two quiet years and relaunched in June 2026 as "PrivateGPT
1.0" (v1.0.0 on 2026-06-03, v1.0.1 on 2026-06-18) with MCP _client_ connectors — again, consuming
MCP tools rather than exposing retrieval as one. Active again after the lull (57.3k★), but has less
of a track record than Khoj or Basic Memory in its current form.

**txtai.** A general-purpose embeddings/search framework rather than a personal-knowledge product —
it has native hybrid BM25+dense scoring built in, which is architecturally close to localdb's RRF
fusion, and is Apache-2.0 licensed, installed via `pip install txtai` with Faiss/HNSW/SQLite
embedded by default (no server required). Broader document extraction (PDF, DOCX, and more) is
available through its optional Textractor pipeline, which wraps Apache Tika — meaning that path
pulls in a JVM dependency, a real contrast with localdb's in-process Rust parsers. It has no
first-party MCP server; the only community MCP wrapper is stale (14★, no commits since April 2025).
Actively maintained as a library/framework (12.7k★), but adopting it as an MCP-facing personal
search server would mean building the MCP layer yourself.

**Recoll.** A mature, GPL desktop full-text search tool built on Xapian, natively compiled (C++/Qt),
with no Python or Node runtime needed. Its official site moved to
[recoll.org](https://www.recoll.org) (from the old lesbonscomptes.com domain) in 2024. Its format
coverage is genuinely broad (PDF, Office documents, email, archives, and more) but relies on
external helper programs (`pdftotext`, `antiword`, etc.) installed separately on the system, where
localdb's parsers are compiled into the single binary with no companion tools to install. No vector
search, no LLM integration, no MCP — it's included here as the classical-IR baseline, and a reminder
that BM25-only search is a legitimate, well-understood choice: hybrid search adds an embedding model
and a vector index to maintain, which is not free.

## Where localdb is behind

In the interest of the same honesty as the README's
[What works today](../README.md#what-works-today) table:

- **As of v0.1.0.** Several of the projects above (Khoj, Basic Memory, AnythingLLM, Onyx) have years
  of production use and large user bases; localdb does not yet.
- **Connector breadth.** Onyx alone ships 40+ SaaS/enterprise connectors today (Slack, Confluence,
  Notion, Google Drive, and more); localdb indexes local files and URLs only, with connectors for
  richer content types on the roadmap but not yet shipped (see below).
- **No GUI or chat interface.** localdb is CLI + MCP only. Anyone wanting a chat-first experience
  out of the box (GPT4All, Khoj, AnythingLLM) will find localdb requires an external agent or client
  to talk to. A web UI is planned (Phase 3 of [specs/06-roadmap.md](../specs/06-roadmap.md)) but
  CLI, MCP, and agents remain the primary surfaces for the foreseeable future.
- **Single-user, single-node.** There is no multi-tenant deployment story today, unlike Onyx.
- **MCP is read-only today.** Mutating tools (`add_source`, `reindex`, and similar) are specified as
  the next planned addition, gated behind an explicit `localdb mcp --allow-write` opt-in flag that
  will never be on by default (see [specs/05-surfaces.md §4](../specs/05-surfaces.md)) — but they
  are not shipped yet. There is deliberately no plan for in-place _edit_ tools: an agent that needs
  to change indexed content can re-add the source and let incremental re-index pick up the change,
  which is a smaller, more auditable surface than exposing note-editing verbs the way Basic Memory
  does.
- **No knowledge graph / entity layer yet.** An entities/graph layer is tracked in
  [specs/06-roadmap.md](../specs/06-roadmap.md) ("tracked but unscheduled: entities/graph layer,
  metadata-only entities first, graph extraction only after baseline retrieval quality is proven")
  but is not designed or built. Basic Memory already has one.
- **File-watch-triggered re-indexing isn't live yet.** `POST /v1/jobs` itself runs real ingestion
  through the daemon's async job queue ([#187](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/187)),
  and `localdb index` (embedded or daemon-attached) drives it with live progress — but nothing yet
  _triggers_ a job automatically when a watched file changes: `server/src/watcher.rs` currently only
  watches for config-file changes in the running daemon, not path-source roots (see
  `core/src/ingestion.rs`, which notes the daemon "adds file watching" as a T11 follow-up). Today,
  keeping an index current still means running `localdb index` again — incremental, but not
  automatic.

## Where localdb is headed that nobody else is

Per [VISION.md](../VISION.md), the long-horizon goal is **federation**: the ability to search
datasets far larger than any one person could assemble alone, by securely sharing direct,
credentialed access to stores — someone's curated book collection, a Wikipedia-scale corpus, a
friend's notes — without proxying content through intermediaries or inventing homegrown crypto.

**None of the eight projects surveyed above do this at all.** Each is scoped to a single user's (or
single organization's) own content. This is the one dimension of this comparison with no current
point of reference, and this document will need revisiting once federation ships.

Two nearer-term axes sit ahead of federation on the roadmap:

- **Ingest all the things.** Files and URLs are indexed today; the domain model already reserves
  typed slots for what's next (`IngestorKind::Notion`, `Telegram`, `Signal`, `HackMd`, `Email`,
  `Transcription`, `Feed` — see `core/src/block.rs`), tracked as Phase 2 in
  [specs/06-roadmap.md](../specs/06-roadmap.md). This would put localdb ahead of the content-scoped
  competitors (GPT4All, Basic Memory) on content coverage well before federation is in scope —
  though it's worth being honest that Onyx's connector library is already larger today (see "Where
  localdb is behind").
- **A knowledge graph, MCP write tools, and eventually a web UI.** An entities/graph layer, MCP
  tools for managing sources and stores (not editing content — see above), and a browse/search web
  UI (Phase 3) are all directional next steps, not committed dates. CLI, MCP, and agentic clients
  remain the primary way to use localdb in the meantime.
