# MCP Server

localdb ships an MCP server that exposes your indexed stores to any MCP-capable AI agent (Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, custom agents). It's built on the official [`rmcp`](https://docs.rs/rmcp) SDK
and speaks the [MCP 2025-06-18 protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Two transports are
available, both serving the same five read-only tools:

- **Stdio** (`localdb mcp`) — the default, no daemon required.
- **HTTP** (`/mcp`, mounted on a running `localdb serve` daemon) — for connecting a remote MCP
  client, or one running on a different machine on your network/Tailscale.

For design rationale and the trust model see [../specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §4.

---

## Setup

### Claude Desktop / any JSON-configured host (stdio)

Add a block to your host's `.mcp.json` (or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localdb": {
      "command": "localdb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

To use a custom config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localdb": {
      "command": "localdb",
      "args": ["mcp", "--config", "/path/to/config.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI (stdio)

```
claude mcp add localdb -- localdb mcp
```

With a custom config:

```
claude mcp add localdb -- localdb mcp --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Remote / HTTP — connecting from another machine

If you run `localdb serve`, it mounts the same five MCP tools at `/mcp` alongside its `/v1` REST
API. This is how to point an MCP client at localdb running on a different machine — e.g. a home
server reachable over Tailscale, or a NAS on your LAN.

1. Start the daemon bound to an address reachable from the client machine (not just `127.0.0.1`).
   Binding to a specific non-loopback address — a Tailscale IP, a LAN IP — is a deliberate,
   supported trust decision; see [docs/http-api.md](http-api.md#trust-model) for the full trust
   model and how to configure it in `config.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   server:
     bind: 100.x.y.z # your Tailscale/LAN address
     port: 7700
   ```

2. On the client machine, register the daemon's `/mcp` endpoint as an HTTP MCP server. For Claude
   Code:

   ```
   claude mcp add --transport http localdb http://100.x.y.z:7700/mcp
   ```

localdb automatically allow-lists whatever address the daemon actually bound to for `rmcp`'s
DNS-rebinding `Host`-header check — you don't need to configure this separately. (Internally: a
deliberately-chosen non-loopback bind is added to the allowlist alongside `rmcp`'s own
`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` defaults; a wildcard bind, `0.0.0.0`/`::`, disables the check
entirely, since it already accepts connections from any network. See
[specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §4.2.)

**Known v1 limitation:** the HTTP `/mcp` route snapshots the daemon's stores once at startup — a
store added later via `POST /v1/stores` won't appear over MCP until the daemon restarts.

---

## Daemon-proxied stdio

If a daemon is already running when you start `localdb mcp`, it detects this the same way every
other localdb command does and **proxies** every request to the daemon's own `/mcp` route instead of
opening the store a second time. This means:

- You no longer need to stop `localdb serve` before using `localdb mcp` — the two now coexist by
  design (this replaces earlier v1 guidance that told you to stop the daemon first).
- Absent `--store`, proxied mode exposes whatever store set the daemon had at its own startup, and
  every request relays verbatim.
- With `--store`, the scope is enforced per request — see [Store scoping](#store-scoping) below.

If no daemon is running, `localdb mcp` opens the store(s) embedded in-process exactly as before — no
behavior change for the common case.

---

## Store scoping

`localdb mcp --store <name>` (repeatable) limits the session to those stores. Use it when an agent
should only see part of your index — a project-bound store, say, rather than everything you have
ever indexed.

```
localdb mcp --store books --store research
```

Omit `--store` and every store is exposed. An unknown name exits `3` before the server starts
serving, in both modes — it is never silently dropped. A database with **no** stores is not an
error: the server starts and exposes zero stores, since an MCP server that exits non-zero at startup
reads to its client as broken rather than as empty.

The scope is enforced in both process modes, by different mechanisms:

| Mode                 | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Embedded (no daemon) | Only the scoped stores are opened. Nothing else is reachable because nothing else exists in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Daemon-proxied       | The scope is applied to every relayed `tools/call`: `search`'s `stores` and `get_document`/`get_chunks`'s optional `store` are filled in (tried against each scoped store in turn) when absent; `list_documents`'s `store` is required, so an absent one is relayed unmodified and surfaces the upstream's own missing-required-argument error instead of being filled in; any explicit `store`/`stores` naming a store outside the scope is rejected; and `list_stores` is filtered so out-of-scope stores cannot even be enumerated. |

Proxied mode has to work through tool arguments because there is no transport-level channel: rmcp's
HTTP service factory is a synchronous `Fn()` with no access to the request, so neither
`/mcp?store=x` nor a custom header can select a scoped handler on the daemon side. The tool
arguments already exist to name stores, so the scope travels per request instead of per connection.

An out-of-scope store name comes back as an ordinary tool-level error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "store 'hydra' is outside this session's --store scope; allowed: [books]"
  }
}
```

While the tool set is fixed at five read-only tools, a scoped session relays only those five; any
other tool name is rejected, so a future mutating tool cannot slip through unscoped on the day it
lands.

> **This is scoping, not a security boundary.** The daemon's `/mcp` route is loopback and
> **unauthenticated**: anything that can open a socket can bypass `localdb mcp` entirely and talk to
> the unscoped endpoint directly. `--store` stops an agent from _accidentally_ reading another
> project's docs; it does not contain a hostile one. Real containment needs daemon-side
> authentication, which does not exist in v1. In embedded mode there is no such endpoint, so the
> scope is as strong as the process boundary.

---

## Tools

The server exposes five read-only tools. Write tools are reserved for a future `--allow-write`
release.

**`--allow-write` currently has no effect.** v1 registers no mutating tool on any transport, so the
tool set is byte-identical with and without the flag; passing it prints a warning to stderr saying
so. It is accepted today only so the CLI surface is stable for callers. (Unlike a misapplied
`--store`, which exits 2, this one only warns: `--allow-write` fails _safe_ — it can withhold a
capability, never widen access.)

### `search`

Hybrid search (BM25 + dense vector) across indexed stores. Returns a ranked list of citations in the
canonical localdb Citation JSON shape.

> **Note:** the dense component uses the configured embedder (default: `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`
> local ONNX). The model is downloaded automatically on first use (~706 MB). See
> [../specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) for the pipeline details.

**Input schema** (as actually returned by `tools/list`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "properties": {
    "content_length": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Soft cap on snippet text chars per result in the text rendering; snaps to the nearest paragraph/sentence/word boundary rather than cutting mid-word (default: 400). The JSON citation payload always carries the full snippet.",
      "format": "int64",
      "minimum": 1,
      "type": ["integer", "null"]
    },
    "limit": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Maximum number of results to return (default: 10, max: 100)",
      "format": "int64",
      "maximum": 100,
      "minimum": 1,
      "type": ["integer", "null"]
    },
    "query": {
      "description": "Natural language search query",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "stores": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Optional list of store names to search. Defaults to all stores.",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "type": ["array", "null"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["query"],
  "type": "object"
}
```

**Example call:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search",
    "arguments": { "query": "reciprocal rank fusion", "limit": 1 }
  }
}
```

**Example result.** The single `text` content block carries the pretty-printed JSON, then a
`\n\n---\n` separator, then a human-readable rendering of the same citations (`search` is the only
tool that appends this rendering; the others return JSON alone):

```json

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,

    "isError": false,

      }
    ]
  }

(`metadata` here is mostly null/empty because a plain `.txt` file carries no Dublin Core metadata —
only `format` is set, from the sniffed MIME type. Every Dublin Core field is always present in the
JSON; absent values serialize as `null` (or `[]` for the repeated fields), never omitted. How much
gets populated depends entirely on the parser:

| Parser                   | Populates                                                                                                                                                                          |

| EPUB                     | `title`, `creator`, `subject`, `description`, `publisher`, `contributor`, `date`, `format`, `identifier`, `language`, `rights` — read from the OPF package's own Dublin Core block |
| Markdown / HTML / Office | `title` (first H1) + `format`                                                                                                                                                      |
| PDF                      | `format` only — the info dictionary is not read                                                                                                                                    |
| Plain text               | `format` only                                                                                                                                                                      |

EPUB is currently the only parser that populates the rich Dublin Core set. YAML front matter is
preserved as a `Frontmatter` content block but is **not** parsed into metadata — see
[#195](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/195). The top-level `title` field is a
convenience copy of `metadata`'s title.)

(The structural fields above — `block`, `chunk_position`, `heading_path`, `location.span`,
`snippet`, `metadata`, `chunk_id`, `resource_id` and `provenance.content_hash` — are captured from a
real indexing run. `score`, `store` and `provenance.fetched_at` are illustrative.)

The citation shape is identical to `localdb search --json`. There is no top-level `document_id`,
`block_seq`, `block_kind`, or `span` — those are superseded by `resource_id`, the nested
`block {seq, kind}`, `chunk_position {seq_in_block}`, and `location {span, window_block_seqs}`
respectively. See [../specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §6 for field
definitions.

### `get_document`

Fetch the normalized text and metadata for a document by its ID.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "default": "",

      "type": "string"
    },
    "store": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Store id or name to restrict the lookup to (e.g. the store.id or store.name from a search result's citation). Defaults to scanning all available stores and returning the first match.",
      "type": ["string", "null"]

      "type": ["string", "null"]
    }
  },
  "type": "object"
}
```

> **v1 limitation:** `uri`-based lookup is not supported. Pass the document `id` from a `search`

### `get_chunks`

Fetch a document's chunks in storage order — `(block_seq, seq_in_block)` — paginated by
`offset`/`limit`, or by an anchor position (`anchor_chunk_id`/`anchor_block_seq`, see
[Anchor-relative pagination](#anchor-relative-pagination) below). Use this to page through a long
document after finding it via `search` or `get_document`.

**Input schema:**

```json

**Example call:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_chunks",
    "arguments": {
      "resource_id": "5e16a53946004c13b941685cddaed55d9267965abe65462bbe75d8e6184f15e7",
      "offset": 0,
      "limit": 50
    }
  }
}
```

**Example result** (`text` carries pretty-printed JSON):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "result": {
    "isError": false,
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\n  \"anchor_index\": null,\n  \"chunks\": [\n    {\n      \"block_kind\": \"text\",\n      \"block_seq\": 0,\n      \"chunk_id\": \"0bbaaa6b64dffd8b232410017b224c7b499bc3fe235382bfaa8ea63b1e435824\",\n      \"heading_path\": [],\n      \"seq_in_block\": 0,\n      \"span\": {\n        \"end\": 165,\n        \"start\": 0\n      },\n      \"text\": \"Meeting 2026-06-02: decided to adopt reciprocal rank fusion for combining dense and sparse retrieval results.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`anchor_index` is `null` here because this call used plain `offset` pagination; see below for what
it carries on an anchor-based call.

---

### Anchor-relative pagination

As an alternative to `offset`, `get_chunks` accepts `anchor_chunk_id` (string) or `anchor_block_seq`
(integer ≥ 0). `offset`, `anchor_chunk_id`, and `anchor_block_seq` are **pairwise mutually
exclusive** — passing more than one of the three in the same call is a tool-level `invalid_request`
error, not a silent precedence rule.

Anchor resolution runs over the resource's full chunk list, sorted the same way as the
plain-`offset` path — `(block_seq, seq_in_block)`:

- `anchor_chunk_id` resolves to the chunk with that exact `chunk_id`. Unknown `anchor_chunk_id` →
  `chunk_not_found`.
- `anchor_block_seq` resolves via lower-bound: the first chunk with `block_seq >= anchor_block_seq`,
  tie-broken by the lowest `seq_in_block` at that `block_seq`. If `anchor_block_seq` is past every
  block in the resource, this is also `chunk_not_found`.

Once an anchor resolves to a position in the full chunk list, the response window is `limit` chunks
**centered** on that position — the anchor sits at, or as close as possible to, the middle of the
returned page — clamped at the start/end of the resource's chunk list. The window never shrinks
below `limit` chunks purely because the anchor is near an edge (it shifts toward the interior
instead); it only returns fewer than `limit` chunks when the resource has fewer than `limit` chunks
in total. The response's `offset` field reports the effective offset the returned window corresponds
to (as if the caller had passed that `offset` directly), and `anchor_index` reports the 0-based
index of the anchor chunk within the returned `chunks` array — `null` when the request used plain
`offset` pagination instead.

**Example** (illustrative — placeholder IDs and elided `text`/`span` values, to show the windowing
arithmetic): a resource with 20 chunks (`block_seq` 0–19, one chunk per block), requested with
`anchor_chunk_id` set to the `block_seq = 10` chunk and `limit: 5`. With an odd `limit`, centering
puts 2 chunks before the anchor and 2 after, so the returned window covers `block_seq` 8–12,
`offset` is 8 (the position of the first returned chunk in the full ordered list), and the anchor is
the 3rd of the 5 returned chunks (`anchor_index: 2`):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 8,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_chunks",
    "arguments": {
      "resource_id": "<resource_id of a 20-chunk document>",
      "anchor_chunk_id": "<chunk_id at block 10>",
      "limit": 5
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 8,
  "result": {
    "isError": false,
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\n  \"anchor_index\": 2,\n  \"chunks\": [\n    { \"block_kind\": \"text\", \"block_seq\": 8, \"chunk_id\": \"...\", \"heading_path\": [], \"seq_in_block\": 0, \"span\": { \"end\": 0, \"start\": 0 }, \"text\": \"...\" },\n    { \"block_kind\": \"text\", \"block_seq\": 9, \"chunk_id\": \"...\", \"heading_path\": [], \"seq_in_block\": 0, \"span\": { \"end\": 0, \"start\": 0 }, \"text\": \"...\" },\n    { \"block_kind\": \"text\", \"block_seq\": 10, \"chunk_id\": \"<anchor chunk_id>\", \"heading_path\": [], \"seq_in_block\": 0, \"span\": { \"end\": 0, \"start\": 0 }, \"text\": \"...\" },\n    { \"block_kind\": \"text\", \"block_seq\": 11, \"chunk_id\": \"...\", \"heading_path\": [], \"seq_in_block\": 0, \"span\": { \"end\": 0, \"start\": 0 }, \"text\": \"...\" },\n    { \"block_kind\": \"text\", \"block_seq\": 12, \"chunk_id\": \"...\", \"heading_path\": [], \"seq_in_block\": 0, \"span\": { \"end\": 0, \"start\": 0 }, \"text\": \"...\" }\n  ],\n  \"limit\": 5,\n  \"offset\": 8,\n  \"resource_id\": \"<resource_id>\",\n  \"returned\": 5,\n  \"store\": { \"id\": \"<store id>\", \"name\": \"<store>\" },\n  \"title\": null,\n  \"total_chunks\": 20,\n  \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/notes/research-log.md\"\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the same `anchor_chunk_id` (`block_seq = 10`) were requested with `limit: 30` against this
20-chunk resource, the window would clamp to the whole list: `offset: 0`, `returned: 20`,
`anchor_index: 10`.

### `list_stores`

List all available stores with their names, visibility, and document/chunk counts.

**Input schema:** `{"properties": {}, "type": "object"}` (no arguments)

**Example call:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "list_stores", "arguments": {} }
}
```

**Example result:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "isError": false,
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\n  \"stores\": [\n    {\n      \"chunk_count\": 3,\n      \"document_count\": 3,\n      \"id\": \"01KTVGQ62TQN8X6XN9E5FDZN67\",\n      \"name\": \"notes\",\n      \"visibility\": \"private\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### `list_documents`

List every document registered in a store, optionally filtered to a source, paginated by
offset/limit. Use this to enumerate what's indexed without going through `search`.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "properties": {
    "store": {
      "description": "Store id or name to list documents from",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "source": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Optional source id to restrict the listing to",
      "type": ["string", "null"]
    },
    "offset": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Number of documents to skip before the first returned document (default: 0)",
      "format": "int64",
      "minimum": 0,
      "type": ["integer", "null"]
    },
    "limit": {
      "default": null,
      "description": "Maximum number of documents to return (default: 50, max: 200)",
      "format": "int64",
      "maximum": 200,
      "minimum": 1,
      "type": ["integer", "null"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["store"],
  "type": "object"
}
```

> Unlike `search`'s `stores` and `get_document`'s/`get_chunks`'s `store`, `store` here is
> **required** — listing is inherently a single-store operation, so there is no "scan every
> available store" default. An unknown store id/name returns `store_not_found`, resolved the same
> way as `search`'s `stores` argument. An unknown `source` id is a pure filter — it yields an empty
> `documents` list, not an error.

**Example call:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 9,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_documents",
    "arguments": { "store": "notes" }
  }
}
```

**Example result:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 9,
  "result": {
    "isError": false,
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\n  \"store\": {\n    \"id\": \"01KTVGQ62TQN8X6XN9E5FDZN67\",\n    \"name\": \"notes\"\n  },\n  \"total\": 1,\n  \"offset\": 0,\n  \"limit\": 50,\n  \"returned\": 1,\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"store_id\": \"01KTVGQ62TQN8X6XN9E5FDZN67\",\n      \"id\": \"5e16a53946004c13b941685cddaed55d9267965abe65462bbe75d8e6184f15e7\",\n      \"source_id\": \"01KTVH6AY4DC84HWW7M2PP4F0X\",\n      \"ingestor_kind\": \"file\",\n      \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/notes/meeting.txt\",\n      \"title\": null,\n      \"mime\": \"text/plain\",\n      \"content_hash\": \"226aa53267d613baa9aaf444cf661ef20a2e9d8e1e9d140819ee2f7044320e4b\",\n      \"fetched_at\": \"2026-06-11T14:17:30Z\",\n      \"origin_store\": \"01KTVGQ62TQN8X6XN9E5FDZN67\",\n      \"policy_version\": \"...\",\n      \"metadata\": { \"kind\": \"document\", \"format\": \"text/plain\", \"...\": \"...\" }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each entry in `documents` is the document registry row (`DocumentInfo`) serialized verbatim — the
same shape `GET /v1/stores/{name}/documents` returns per item (see
[docs/http-api.md](http-api.md#get-v1storesnamedocuments)) — not the `get_document` tool's shape
(which adds `chunk_count`/`text` and omits `mime`/`ingestor_kind`/`origin_store`/`policy_version`).

---

## Error model

MCP failures split into exactly two tiers, by whether the request could be _routed_ to a tool at
all. See [specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §4.3 for the full rationale — this section
shows what each tier actually looks like on the wire.

**Tool-level** (`result.isError: true`) — everything you're likely to hit in practice: a missing or
malformed argument, an unknown store name, a not-found lookup, an out-of-range `limit`/`offset`.
This includes cases you might expect to be protocol-level, like a missing required argument:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "failed to deserialize parameters: missing field `query`" }
    ],
    "isError": true
  }
}
```

Business-logic errors (unknown store, not-found document, etc.) carry a structured
`{"error": {"code", "message"}}` JSON body as their text content instead of a plain string, e.g.
`{"error": {"code": "store_not_found", "message": "no store named 'x'"}}`.

**Protocol-level** (a JSON-RPC error, no `result` field) — only one case: calling a tool name that
doesn't exist at all.

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 5, "error": { "code": -32602, "message": "tool not found" } }
```

In proxied stdio mode (see [Daemon-proxied stdio](#daemon-proxied-stdio) above), both tiers pass
through from the daemon's `/mcp` route unchanged. A failure of the proxy hop itself (daemon
unreachable, connection dropped mid-request) is a distinct case with no upstream answer to relay a
tier from — the CLI reports this as `daemon_unreachable` (exit code 5).

---

## Embedded mode

When no daemon is running, `localdb mcp` opens the store databases in-process (embedded mode). This
is the normal operating mode and requires no prior setup beyond having run `localdb index`.

If a daemon _is_ running, see [Daemon-proxied stdio](#daemon-proxied-stdio) above — `localdb mcp`
proxies to it automatically rather than conflicting with it.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnosing a rejected connection

`localdb serve` and `localdb mcp` log rejected/failed connections at `warn` level: a 4xx/5xx
response from any daemon route (`/v1/*` or the nested `/mcp` mount — including rmcp's own
Host-header check, see below) is logged with method, path, status, and the request's `Host` header;
a failed proxy connect from `localdb mcp` to the daemon (stale `LOCALDB_DAEMON_URL`, or the daemon
going away between the initial probe and the actual connect) is logged with the daemon URL and the
underlying transport error.

Both surface on stderr **by default**, no `RUST_LOG` needed — `localdb`'s default log filter is
`warn,pdf_oxide=off` (set in `localdb/src/main.rs`), which passes `warn`-level events through. Set
`RUST_LOG=debug` (or `RUST_LOG=localdb=debug`) for more detail.

### `daemon is unreachable` (exit 5) / stale socket

If the daemon was killed with `SIGKILL` (or crashed), it may leave a stale `daemon.sock` file in the
data directory. Remove it:

```
rm <data_dir>/daemon.sock
```

After removing the socket, `localdb status` should report `daemon: not running (embedded mode)` and
the MCP server will start normally.

### A remote HTTP MCP client reports "needs authentication"

This isn't an auth prompt — it's almost always `rmcp`'s DNS-rebinding `Host`-header check rejecting
the request with `403 Forbidden: Host header is not allowed`, which some MCP clients surface as a
generic auth failure. As of this release, localdb automatically allow-lists the daemon's own bind
address (see [Remote / HTTP](#remote--http--connecting-from-another-machine) above), so this should
no longer happen for a supported (non-wildcard) bind — if you still hit it, confirm the daemon's
`config.yaml` `server.bind` matches the address/port you're actually connecting to, and that you've
restarted `localdb serve` after changing it.
