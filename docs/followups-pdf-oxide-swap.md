# Follow-up issues from the pdf_oxide swap + page citations (#87/#65/#103/#45)

These were identified while implementing the parser swap and page-number plumbing. They are
intentionally **not** on that branch. File each as its own issue (drafts below are ready to paste).
`gh` was unauthenticated when the drafts were written; it has since been authenticated and the
extraction-quality follow-ups **have been filed** (see the index below). The remaining drafts in §1,
§2, §3, §4, §5 and §6 are still unfiled.

Extended rather than duplicated, as comments on existing issues: **#157** (gibberish-chunk
calibration cases), **#159** (back-matter boilerplate, not just headings), **#95** (near-duplicates
across formats are _not_ covered by `content_hash` dedup), **#97** (EPUB `heading_path` still
empty), **#94** (widened to the `Citation.snippet` boundary-snap contract), **#43** (an `OCR/` path
is no evidence OCR succeeded).

## 1. Upstream (pdf_oxide): relax the `ort` exact pin `=2.0.0-rc.11`

**Repo:** yfedoseev/pdf_oxide · **Type:** dependency-compat

pdf_oxide's `ocr` / `gpu` features pin `ort = "=2.0.0-rc.11"`. Our `embed` crate pins
`ort = "=2.0.0-rc.12"` (issue #133 setup: load-dynamic, default-features off). If we ever enable
pdf_oxide's `ocr` feature in the same build, the two exact pins conflict and the workspace won't
resolve. Request: widen the `ort` constraint (e.g. `>=2.0.0-rc.11, <2.1` or track our rc.12) so
downstreams that already depend on `ort` can share one version.

Not blocking us today — we ship pdf_oxide with **default features only, no `ocr`**, so `ort` is
absent from the PDF path entirely.

## 2. Upstream (pdf_oxide): expose execution-provider / session-options config for OCR

**Repo:** yfedoseev/pdf_oxide · **Type:** feature-request

The `ocr` feature runs PaddleOCR through `ort` but exposes no execution-provider / session-options
API, so OCR is CPU-only through the public API — no CoreML (ANE/GPU) or CUDA. Request: a way to pass
EP/session options (mirroring `ort`'s `SessionBuilder`) so callers can select hardware acceleration.
Blocks efficient OCR when we pick up #43.

## 2a. Upstream (pdf_oxide): `strip_running_headers_footers` deletes body text

**Repo:** yfedoseev/pdf_oxide · **Type:** bug · **Severity:** data loss

`ConversionOptions::strip_running_headers_footers: true` silently removes words from the middle of
body paragraphs in multi-column documents. We enabled it, measured the damage, and reverted to
`include_artifacts: false` alone.

**Root cause** (0.3.77, `src/document.rs`):

- `repeated_running_head_foot(0.6)` collects candidate strings from individual **`TextSpan`s**
  (glyph runs), not from assembled lines, keeping any whose normalized text is longer than 3 chars
  and occurs in the head/foot band on ≥60% of pages.
- `in_head_foot_band` is the top or bottom **15%** of the page. In a two-column journal the first
  line of _every column_ falls inside that band and is genuine body text.
- `is_running_head_foot` then drops **any** span in the band whose normalized text is in that set —
  on every page, regardless of context.

So a short, frequent phrase-fragment becomes a global deletion rule.

**Reproduction** — `extract/tests/fixtures/corpus/plos-compbio-two-column.pdf` (CC BY 4.0, committed
in this repo), per-page `to_markdown` with only `strip_running_headers_footers: true` flipped:

```
"gene function—how individual genes contribute to"
  → "gene function—how  contribute to"
"and performed a statistical analysis, the results of which"
  → "and  analysis, the results of which"
"As representatives of the international consortium that produces the GO,
 we show how the apparent evidence"
  → "As representatives  consortium that produces the  apparent evidence"
"knowledge obtained in mouse and human experimental systems was incorrectly
 interpreted as a disagreement"
  → "knowledge obtained  experimental systems was incorrectly  disagreement"
```

Net −874 chars (−2.2%) with no indication anything was lost.

**Suggested fixes:** match assembled _lines_ rather than spans; require the candidate to be the full
band line, not a substring of body text; narrow the band (15% of a page is a lot of body text in a
dense layout); and require a much higher minimum length than 3 chars.

### Residual risk accepted with `include_artifacts: false`

We now drop `/Artifact`-tagged spans (`spans.retain(|s| s.artifact_type.is_none())`, dropping
`Pagination`/`Layout`/`Page`/`Background`). That is spec-correct per ISO 32000-1 §14.8.2.2.1 and is
the safe half of the running-header fix — but it is the first configuration in which a
correctly-parsed span can be dropped on purpose. A producer that **over-tags** body content as
`/Artifact` (a known real-world tagging bug) would therefore lose that content silently. No corpus
fixture exercises an over-tagged PDF today; worth adding one if such a document turns up. The trade
is deliberate: the failure requires a broken producer, whereas indexing running headers and
page-number folios as content was happening on every well-formed tagged PDF.

## 2b. Upstream (pdf_oxide): dehyphenation is not wired into `to_markdown()`

**Repo:** yfedoseev/pdf_oxide · **Type:** bug / inconsistency

`TextPostProcessor::rejoin_hyphenated_words` correctly strips U+00AD and joins line-break hyphens
per PDF spec ISO 32000-1 §14.8.2.2.3, but it is reachable only from the **deprecated**
`MarkdownConverter` path and from the opt-in `apply_intelligent_text_processing()`. The
`to_markdown()` path — the documented, non-deprecated API — never calls it, so soft hyphens land in
the output verbatim.

We work around it with a local `strip_soft_hyphens` (delete U+00AD unconditionally; we deliberately
do **not** re-implement the line-break join, which is where `well-being` → `wellbeing` corruption
comes from). Request: either call the post-processor from `to_markdown()`, or expose it as a
`ConversionOptions` flag so callers do not have to reimplement it.

## 2c. Upstream (pdf_oxide): monospace→code fencing over-fires on book prose

**Repo:** yfedoseev/pdf_oxide · **Type:** bug / heuristic-tuning

`fence_monospace_blocks()` wraps a paragraph in a bare ` ``` ` fence whenever its glyph runs report
`is_monospace`. On typeset novels this fires on ordinary quoted dialogue, so narrative prose is
emitted as a code block and downstream consumers label it `block_kind: "code"`.

Relatedly, `detect_headings`' font-clustering promotes multi-line terminal transcripts to `#`
headings in technical books; `is_valid_heading_text` / `demote_body_like_headings` do not catch
them.

We guard both locally (`demote_prose_fenced_as_code`, `demote_spurious_headings` in
`extract/src/pdf.rs`) and will delete our guards if these are fixed upstream. Request: require
corroborating signals beyond `is_monospace` (line-length variance, indentation structure, symbol
density) before fencing, and beyond font size before promoting a heading.

## 3. Thread a real `extractor_version` into the reindex skip-check (cross-ref #47)

**Repo:** dokterbob/localdb · **Type:** correctness / tech-debt

`extractor_version` is dead code: hardcoded `"1"` in both ingestors and in
`store-libsql/src/tenant/write.rs` (the resource upsert), and never read by the skip-check at
`core/src/ingestion.rs` (which keys only on `content_hash`).

The pdf_oxide swap self-triggers reindexing because extracted text — and thus `compute_blocks_hash`
— changes. But a parser change that produces byte-identical text for some document would leave it
stale (and page-less) with no re-extraction. Thread a real per-parser `extractor_version` from the
parser through the ingestors into the store and into the skip-check, so a parser version bump forces
re-extraction deterministically and yields a natural "N PDFs re-extracted" log line. See known-gaps
§8 in `docs/architecture.md`.

## 4. Fix workspace license metadata: `MIT` vs AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE`

**Repo:** dokterbob/localdb · **Type:** metadata / one-line PR

The workspace `Cargo.toml` declares `license = "MIT"` (line ~19) while the repo `LICENSE` file is
AGPL-3.0. Reconcile — most likely `license = "AGPL-3.0-or-later"` in the workspace
`[workspace.package]`. Separate one-line PR, not on the PDF branch.

## 5. #157 quality gate: `is_indexable_text` filter in `index_resource`

**Repo:** dokterbob/localdb · **Type:** quality (existing issue #157)

Add an `is_indexable_text` filter over `chunk_outputs` in `core/src/ingestion.rs::index_resource`,
right after the `chunk_blocks` call and before the `is_empty` check, to drop mojibake /
non-indexable chunks. Calibrate against the Phase A mojibake fixtures
(`extract/tests/fixtures/malformed/cid_no_tounicode.pdf`) and the corpus CJK cases. The corpus
test's `forbid_substrings` (U+FFFD) guard is the regression net.

## 6. #43 OCR: scanned-PDF support behind a Cargo feature

**Repo:** dokterbob/localdb · **Type:** feature (existing issue #43)

Scanned PDFs still hard-`Err` (`UnsupportedFormat`). When picked up, OCR slots into the same
`extract_pdf` seam: `detect_page_type`/`classify_page` → `extract_text_with_ocr`, behind a Cargo
feature, with load-dynamic `ort` matching `embed`'s #133 pattern (and hardware accel gated on
follow-up #2 above). Open design question for that ticket: does `extract` gain an `ort` dependency,
or does OCR live in a separate crate?

## Release-note callout (for the next release notes, not an issue)

> **PDFs re-index automatically.** The PDF text extractor was replaced (`pdf-extract` →
> `pdf_oxide`): PDFs now extract to structured Markdown, no longer crash on malformed content
> streams, and stop emitting mojibake for CMap-less fonts. Search citations from PDFs now carry a
> page number (`(p.N)`). Because the extracted text changes, every PDF gets a new content hash and
> re-indexes on your next `localdb index` — a one-time re-embedding cost. (Edge case: a PDF whose
> new extraction is byte-identical to the old keeps its old hash and stays page-less until re-added;
> see known-gaps §8.)
>
> **PDF extraction quality.** Extraction is now tuned for retrieval rather than visual fidelity.
> Running headers, footers, page-number folios and watermarks tagged as artifacts are dropped
> instead of becoming their own chunks; ligatures (`ﬁ`, `ﬂ`, …) are expanded so search matches real
> words; soft hyphens are removed so `recon‐struction` indexes as `reconstruction`; pages with no
> text layer are dropped with a warning naming them, instead of having a placeholder marker indexed
> as content. Misdetected headings no longer poison the `heading_path` breadcrumb of every following
> chunk, and a novel's dialogue is no longer served as `block_kind: "code"`.
>
> **PDF metadata.** PDFs now populate Dublin Core (`creator`, `subject`, `description`, `date`,
> `language`, `rights`) from the Info dictionary and XMP, closing the gap where the same book as PDF
> and as EPUB looked like two differently-described resources.
>
> These changes alter extracted text, so — like the swap itself — they change every PDF's content
> hash. Both land in the same release **on purpose**: that is one re-index and one re-embedding pass
> rather than two. On a large store (the QA corpus was 1,063 documents / 642k chunks) this is a
> significant one-time cost, so plan the first `localdb index` after upgrading accordingly.
