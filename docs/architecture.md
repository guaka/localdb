# localdb — Contributor Architecture Guide

> Version 0.1.0 · AGPL-3.0-or-later · github.com/dokterbob/localdb

This document orients new contributors: crate boundaries, data flow, process model, on-disk layout,
and a frank account of what is not yet wired. For design rationale and decisions behind each choice,
follow the links into the `specs/` tree — that is the authority; this document is the behavior layer
on top of it.

---

## Crate map

The workspace is a single Cargo workspace with one binary (`localdb`) built from eight crates. No
retrieval, indexing, or domain logic lives in a surface crate — all surfaces share one core (see
[specs/01-architecture.md](../specs/01-architecture.md) §1).

### `core`

The domain model and shared logic. Defines every entity (`Store`, `Source`, `Document`, `Chunk`,
`IndexJob`, `Citation`), the two key traits (`RetrievalStore` and `Embedder`), content-addressed ID
derivation (blake3), the RRF fusion engine, indexing orchestration, and the error taxonomy. Contains
no I/O framework; everything async-capable lives in other crates. This is the crate everything else
imports.

### `extract`

Format detection and extraction. Accepts raw bytes and returns a normalized Markdown string plus
`DocumentMetadata` extracted from frontmatter (Dublin Core fields). Supported in v1: Markdown
(pulldown-cmark), plain text, HTML (readability-style), and text-layer PDF. Binary files and
non-UTF-8 content are declined gracefully. Unsupported or unreadable files are counted as
skipped/errored in `IndexJob` stats, never fatal. See
[specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) §2.

### `embed`

`Embedder` implementations. Declares providers for local ONNX inference (`OnnxEmbedder`,
feature-gated `local-onnx`), local CoreML inference on Apple Silicon (feature-gated `local-coreml`,
macOS-only), OpenAI-compatible flat HTTP endpoints (`OpenAiEmbedder`), Perplexity contextualized
embeddings (`PerplexityEmbedder`), and Voyage (`VoyageEmbedder`). All implement the document-aware
`Embedder` trait from `core`, which groups chunks by document so contextualized/late-chunking models
can use the surrounding document as context. The CLI wires the embedder via `embed::create_embedder`
from the config policy; the default is `local` / `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`. The `local` provider
auto-selects the CoreML (ANE/GPU) backend on Apple Silicon macOS when built with
`--features local-coreml`, falling back to ONNX (CPU) otherwise; `local-coreml` / `local-onnx` force
a backend. The two backends emit index-interchangeable vectors. See
[specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) §4 and the
[Platform notes](#platform-notes) below.

### `store-libsql`

The `RetrievalStore` trait implementation backed by libsql (DiskANN vectors + FTS5 BM25). A single
unified database file at `<data_dir>/localdb.db` holds everything. BM25 full-text search uses
SQLite's FTS5 virtual table. Dense search uses the DiskANN vector index (`libsql_vector_idx`). RRF
fusion is done in `core`. In-process, writes serialise on one mutex-guarded writer connection while
reads are served from a small round-robin pool of read-only connections, so reads no longer block on
writes within a process. See [specs/01-architecture.md](../specs/01-architecture.md) §2.

Schema changes go through an explicit migrations runner (`store-libsql/src/migrations/`): a frozen
baseline DDL snapshot (`baseline.rs`, `PRAGMA user_version = 4`) plus a linear, numbered chain of
`Migration` entries applied one transaction at a time. A `schema_migrations` table is the source of
truth for version, with `PRAGMA user_version` kept as a cheap, non-authoritative marker. **Opening a
store never migrates it, in either direction** — a version mismatch on open is refused with an
actionable hint, on every surface (CLI, HTTP daemon, MCP alike). The only way to change a store's
schema version is `localdb db migrate` / `localdb db downgrade [--to N]` (CLI-only; `db status` is
read-only and never refuses). See [docs/migrations.md](migrations.md) for the full user-facing and
authoring guide, and [specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §9 /
[specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §2.1 for the design.

### `cli`

Command implementations. A thin layer on `core` and the daemon client; no business logic. Each
command handler acquires config and runtime state, probes the daemon socket, then either delegates
to the HTTP API (thin-client mode) or opens the store in-process (embedded mode). Calls
`embed::create_embedder` from the config policy to obtain the embedder for `index` and `search`;
`FakeEmbedder` is used only in unit tests.

### `server`

The axum-based HTTP API daemon. Exposes the `/v1` REST surface, manages the daemon unix socket for
discovery, runs the file-watcher (`notify`), the URL refresh scheduler, and the background job
queue. Opens the same unified database (`<data_dir>/localdb.db`) as the CLI; CLI-indexed data is
visible. Multi-process is the first-class concurrency model — the daemon is one writer among peers
(CLI sessions, multiple stdio MCP servers); concurrent writers serialise via SQLite WAL +
`busy_timeout=5000`. Ingestion via `POST /v1/jobs` runs the real pipeline
(`server::job_exec::run_job`) through an async job queue with a configurable worker pool
(`server.job_workers`, default 1) and a per-store in-flight guard (issues #187, #208) — not a stub;
a second submission for a store already running rejects with `index_in_progress`, 409, while jobs
for different stores run concurrently up to `server.job_workers` workers. `GET /jobs/{id}/events`
streams the job's live progress over SSE (issue #83). The URL-refresh scheduler submits through the
same job engine. See [specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §3.

### `mcp`

MCP server built on the official `rmcp` SDK (full macro-native `#[tool_router]`/ `#[tool_handler]`),
speaking the same `Citation` shape that every other surface uses. Exposes four read-only tools —
`search`, `get_document`, `get_chunks`, `list_stores`. Served over two transports: stdio
(`localdb mcp`, embedded-in-process or, if a daemon is already running, proxied to its `/mcp` route
— see `mcp/src/proxy.rs`) and HTTP (`/mcp`, mounted on `server`'s axum router alongside `/v1` — see
`mcp/src/http.rs` and `server/src/mcp_bridge.rs`). The `--allow-write` flag is parsed for forward
compatibility but write tools are rejected in v1 on both transports. See
[specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §4.

### `localdb` (binary)

The single-binary entry point. Parses the top-level subcommand tree with clap and delegates to the
appropriate crate. No logic of its own. Subcommands: `init`, `serve`, `mcp`, `status`, `store`,
`source`, `index`, `search`.

```

Content-addressed IDs (`blake3`) flow through every step: documents get `blake3(uri ‖ content_hash)`
and chunks get `blake3(resource_id ‖ block_seq ‖ chunk_text ‖ seq_in_block)`, making re-indexing
idempotent. Span (byte offsets) is deliberately excluded — it can shift slightly between runs (e.g.
from whitespace-normalization tweaks) without the chunk's actual membership changing, which would
otherwise needlessly churn IDs. See [specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §3.

The `Citation` is the canonical output shape used by every surface — CLI, HTTP, and MCP all return
the same structure. See [specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §6.

## Process model

```
  localdb search / localdb mcp
         │
         ▼
  probe <data_dir>/daemon.sock
         │
    ┌────┴────────────────┐
    │ socket present       │ socket absent
    │ and responsive       │ (or missing)
    ▼                      ▼
  thin client          embedded mode
  (HTTP to daemon)     open store in-process
```

On every invocation, CLI and MCP probe a unix socket at `<data_dir>/daemon.sock`. If a daemon is
running and responsive, the command routes over HTTP. If not, the store is opened in-process (libsql
database; embeddings come from the configured embedder, defaulting to the local ONNX model). No
configuration is needed for the common case. See
[specs/01-architecture.md](../specs/01-architecture.md) §3.

---

## On-disk layout

The config file and the data directory are independent paths (`--config` / `LOCALDB_CONFIG` choose
the former; `paths.data` the latter). Both are created implicitly on first use (or explicitly via
`localdb init`); after `localdb index` has run:

```
<config_dir>/
  config.yaml                  # YAML config (version: 1)

<data_dir>/
  localdb.db                   # SQLite (WAL): unified database
  localdb.db-wal               # WAL sidecar (libsql managed)
  localdb.db-shm               # shared-memory sidecar (libsql managed)
  daemon.sock                  # unix socket (present only while daemon runs)
```

The default `data_dir` on macOS is `~/Library/Application Support/localdb/data`. Override with
`paths.data` in `config.yaml` or point to a custom config with `--config`.

The `models/` directory (configured via `paths.models`) is populated on first `localdb index` or
`localdb search` when the default `local` embedder downloads `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` (~706 MB
ONNX) from HuggingFace. On Apple Silicon macOS built with `--features local-coreml`, the CoreML
bundle is additionally fetched from `dokterbob/pplx-embed-coreml` (XET-deduped via `hf-hub` 1.0).
Subsequent runs use the cached model.

`--features local-onnx` builds (the default on Linux; the ONNX fallback on macOS) additionally
populate `<cache_dir>/localdb/ort/<version>/` on first use with the embedded ONNX Runtime shared
library — a separate, sibling directory to `models/`, not configurable via `paths.*`. See
[Platform notes: ONNX Runtime loading](#platform-notes).

## Platform notes {#platform-notes}

**CoreML embedding backend (macOS / Apple Silicon).** The default `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` model
can run on Apple's ANE/GPU via a CoreML backend in `embed`, behind the opt-in `local-coreml` cargo
feature (macOS-only; every code path is
`#[cfg(all(target_os = "macos", feature = "local-coreml"))]`). Build it with
`cargo build -p localdb --features local-coreml`. Because the feature pulls edition-2024
dependencies (`hf-hub` 1.0), it requires **Rust ≥ 1.85** — but that floor is subsumed: since the
`pdf_oxide` PDF parser landed, the workspace `rust-version` is **1.88** on every platform
(`pdf_oxide` itself declares `rust-version = "1.88"`, and it pulls `image` 0.25, which needs the
same). Default builds (feature off) are unaffected and remain ONNX-only — Linux and CI default
builds never touch any CoreML code.

The default `local` provider auto-selects CoreML on Apple Silicon when the feature is built and the
bundle loads, otherwise falls back to ONNX (CPU). `local-coreml` forces CoreML (hard error if
unavailable); `local-onnx` forces ONNX. CoreML and ONNX vectors are index-interchangeable (same
`model_id`, 1024-dim, `Binary`; measured ~0.995–0.9995 cosine parity, ~98–99% per-dimension sign
agreement), so switching backends needs no reindex. See [specs/03-config.md](../specs/03-config.md)
§7 and [specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) §4.

**ONNX Runtime loading (`local-onnx`, all platforms).** `embed`'s `ort` dependency uses the
`load-dynamic` feature — the `localdb` executable links no ONNX Runtime ABI at all and instead
`dlopen`s a shared library at a path chosen at runtime. `embed/build.rs` downloads _Microsoft's
official_ ONNX Runtime release (pinned to 1.24.4) for the build's target platform (`linux-x64`,
`linux-aarch64`, `osx-arm64`), verifies it against a pinned sha256, and embeds it into the `embed`
crate via `include_bytes!`. On first construction of any local-ONNX embedder,
`embed::ort_runtime::ensure_ort_initialized` extracts that embedded library to
`<cache_dir>/localdb/ort/<version>/` (mirroring the model-cache convention; idempotent — skipped if
an up-to-date copy is already there) and calls `ort::init_from` on it before any other `ort` API is
touched. Embedding the runtime grows the `localdb` binary by roughly 12–20 MB depending on platform
(measured: +11.8 MiB on macOS arm64, where it also replaced the previous statically-linked archive);
the compressed release tarballs grow less.

Two overrides exist for power users / distro packagers who want to supply their own ONNX Runtime
instead of the embedded one:

- `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` (runtime env var): `ensure_ort_initialized` honours this directly and `dlopen`s
  that path instead of extracting the embedded copy.
- `LOCALDB_ORT_LIB` (build-time env var, read by `embed/build.rs`): points the _build_ at a local
  ONNX Runtime library to embed instead of downloading one (offline/distro builds).

Both overrides require ONNX Runtime **≥ 1.24** — `fastembed`'s own (unconditional) `ort` dependency
declaration requests the `api-24` feature regardless of which `fastembed` features we enable, so
despite `embed`'s own `ort` dependency line specifying no `api-*` feature, Cargo feature unification
still enables `api-24` for the whole build. This is why the pinned embedded version is exactly
1.24.4, not an older 1.17–1.23 release.

Why this exists: `ort`'s `download-binaries` feature (the previous approach) statically links
pyke.io's prebuilt ONNX Runtime archive into `ort-sys`. That archive is built with GCC 14 on Ubuntu
24.04 and references `__isoc23_strtol*` symbols, giving the _release binary itself_ a `GLIBC_2.38`
floor — it refused to start on glibc-2.35 distros (Linux Mint 21.x, Ubuntu 22.04). It was also
ABI-incompatible with GCC-11 libstdc++ when built on ubuntu-22.04. See
[issue #133](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/133) and
[pykeio/ort#523](https://github.com/pykeio/ort/issues/523) (unresolved upstream). The Microsoft
official Linux builds we embed instead float at `GLIBC_2.27` / `GLIBCXX_3.4.22` / `CXXABI_1.3.11`
(verified via `objdump -T`), comfortably under Ubuntu 22.04's `GLIBC_2.35` baseline; the embedded
macOS dylib declares a minimum of macOS 14.0 (`LC_BUILD_VERSION`). Because our own Rust code still
inherits the _build machine's_ glibc floor independent of this mechanism, the release and CI
workflows also pin Linux builds to `ubuntu-22.04` (not `ubuntu-latest`) and verify both the
`localdb` binary and the embedded `.so` stay at or below `GLIBC_2.35`.

## Known gaps {#known-gaps}

This section documents verified divergences between the specs and the v0.1.0 implementation. They
are listed honestly so contributors know where work remains. Each item names the responsible code
area.

**Recently closed, not (re)listed below:** `--store` used to be honored only by `search`/`mcp` —
every other command silently operated on an arbitrary store instead of respecting the flag's absence
consistently (#178, #118). `--store` is now resolved and validated the same way everywhere, with a
per-command default documented in
[specs/05-surfaces.md §2.2](../specs/05-surfaces.md#22-store-scope): all stores for
`search`/`status`/`store list`/`index`, the store named `default` for `source`/`add`, and rejected
outright for `db status`/`migrate`/`downgrade`. Separately, MCP `get_document`/`get_chunks` now
accept an optional `store` argument (id or name) to disambiguate a document id that exists in more
than one store (#144; see [docs/mcp.md](mcp.md#get_document)). Gaps #6 and #7 below (the `/mcp` HTTP
store-list snapshot and daemon-proxied `localdb mcp --store`) are related but distinct and remain
open.

**1. ~~HTTP daemon `POST /v1/jobs` is a no-op~~ — RESOLVED.**
([#187](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/187),
[#208](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/208)) `POST /v1/jobs` now runs the real ingestion
pipeline (`server::job_exec::run_job`) through an async job queue with a configurable worker pool
(`server.job_workers`, default 1) and a per-store in-flight guard — a duplicate submission for a
store already running rejects with `index_in_progress` (409), rather than silently no-opping.
`localdb index` submits a job to the daemon and attaches to `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/events` (SSE, issue
#83) for live progress, falling back to polling `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` if the stream can't be
established; the summary, `--json`, and `--strict` output are identical to embedded mode.
`index --delete` also works daemon-attached now (`deletion_policy` on the job request). Stopping the
daemon before `localdb index` is no longer necessary. See
[specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §2/§3 for the full contract. The worker-pool size
(`server.job_workers`) is operator-configurable as of #208: values greater than 1 let jobs for
different stores run concurrently, while the per-store guard still prevents two concurrent jobs on
the same store from racing regardless of pool size.

**Gap #2. `source add` does not validate path existence.**
([#14](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/14)) **Resolved as of 2026-06-28:**
`cli/src/lib.rs` now validates path existence in `run_source_add_async` via `normalize_path_source`.
`localdb source add /does/not/exist --store notes` succeeds (exit 0) even when the path does not
exist on disk. Validation is deferred to index time. The source spec validation in
`core/src/config/` or the CLI source-add handler is the place to add an existence check.

**Gap #3. macOS default paths use a verbose bundle ID.**
([#15](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/15)) **Resolved as of 2026-06-28:**
`core/src/config/platform.rs` now uses `ProjectDirs::from("", "", "localdb")`, so macOS defaults
live under a plain `localdb` segment — config and data at `~/Library/Application Support/localdb/`,
the model cache at `~/Library/Caches/localdb/models/`, logs at `~/Library/Logs/localdb/` — matching
the paths `specs/03-config.md` specifies.

**4. The CoreML context bundle ships only the L512 sequence-length bucket.** The CoreML backend
(`local-coreml` feature; see [Platform notes](#platform-notes)) reads its bucket manifest from HF
repo `dokterbob/pplx-embed-coreml`. Today only the `context/L512-int8` bucket is published. The
larger context buckets (`L ∈ {1024, 2048, 4096}`) are picked up automatically from the manifest once
published, so no code change is needed. This XET-deduped download that shares the ~1.15 GB encoder
weights across buckets relies on the `hf-hub` 1.0 pre-release.

**5. Sources added before the include-allowlist change keep empty `include` globs.** As of the
`only-index-supported-files` branch, `cli` automatically sets `DEFAULT_PATH_INCLUDES` (an
extension-based allowlist) on new directory sources that have no explicit `include` globs. Sources
that were added before this change already have an empty `include` list recorded in the unified
database and will continue to index all files they enumerate until they are removed and re-added
with `localdb source add`. There is no automatic migration, and this change is intentionally not
folded into `policy_version`. The per-file chunk preset is determined deterministically from the
filename/MIME type at index time, so re-indexing existing content with the new code produces correct
results without a policy-hash change.

**6. `/mcp` (HTTP) doesn't see stores added after daemon startup.**
`server::mcp_bridge::build_available_stores` snapshots the daemon's store list once, at
`start_daemon` time — a store added later via `POST /v1/stores` is invisible over MCP until the
daemon restarts. Root cause: `rmcp`'s Streamable HTTP service factory is synchronous, so there's no
hook to redo the async `AppState` lookup per session without an ugly blocking bridge. See
[docs/mcp.md](mcp.md#remote-http-connecting-from-another-machine).

**7. MCP `--store` scoping is a guardrail, not a security boundary.** `localdb mcp --store <name>`
does now narrow the store set in both stdio modes (issue #201 — proxied mode used to warn and serve
the daemon's _full_ store set, which silently widened access exactly when the caller asked to narrow
it). In proxied mode the scope is enforced per request, on the `stores`/`store` tool arguments,
because `rmcp`'s Streamable HTTP service factory is synchronous and has no access to the request —
so there is no transport-level channel for a per-connection scope (same root cause as gap 6 above).

The residual gap is containment, not enforcement: the daemon's `/mcp` route is loopback and
**unauthenticated**, so any process that can open a socket can bypass `localdb mcp` and talk to it
unscoped. This stops an agent reading another project's docs by accident; it does not contain a
hostile one. Closing it needs daemon-side auth, which v1 does not have. Embedded mode has no such
endpoint, so there the scope is as strong as the process boundary. See
[docs/mcp.md](mcp.md#store-scoping) and [specs/05-surfaces.md](../specs/05-surfaces.md) §4.2.1.

**8. `extractor_version` is dead code; PDF reindex relies on the content hash.** The
`extractor_version` field is hardcoded (`"1"` in both ingestors and in `store-libsql`'s resource
upsert) and is never read by the skip-check — that check keys only on `content_hash`. The
`pdf-extract` → `pdf_oxide` swap changes the extracted text of every PDF, so the content hash
changes and PDFs re-index automatically on the next `localdb index` (picking up page citations and
better text). `compute_blocks_hash` folds in each block's page, so a _repagination_ that leaves text
and kinds unchanged also changes the hash and re-indexes. The one residual gap: if a future parser
change produces _byte-identical_ text **and identical pages** for some PDF, the hash is unchanged
and that document is not re-extracted. Threading a real per-parser `extractor_version` into the
skip-check would close that last axis and is a deferred follow-up (cross-ref
[#47](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/47)).

**9. Residual PDF-extraction gaps.** `extract/src/pdf.rs` repairs several classes of upstream
extraction defect (see [specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) §"PDF
extraction is tuned for retrieval"). These remain:

- **No title fallback.** A PDF carrying neither `/Title` nor XMP `dc:title` gets `title: null`.
  There is deliberately no filename or first-page heuristic — a guessed title presented as metadata
  is worse than an absent one.
- **Heading and code-block inference is heuristic, and upstream.** Headings come from the
  extractor's font clustering and code blocks from its monospace detection. Our guards suppress
  **false positives only**: a heading the extractor never detected (a Part title in a different
  face, say) cannot be recovered, so `heading_path` will keep reporting the last heading it did see.
  Conversely, code that reads as English prose — Inform 7, period-terminated Gherkin, pseudocode
  paragraphs — is un-fenced and labelled `text`. Both cost a wrong label, never altered text.
- **Spurious intra-word spaces.** Glyph-run clustering can split a word (`"consid ered"`,
  `"investi tions"`). There is no hyphen and no positional signal left after reflow, so rejoining
  needs sentence context rather than a regex: English is full of legitimate pairs whose
  concatenation is also a word (`a bout`/`about`, `in to`/`into`, `any one`/`anyone`), and
  misjoining those silently changes meaning. Tracked separately.
- **Untagged running headers survive.** Artifact-tagged furniture is dropped, but a PDF that does
  not tag its running heads keeps them. The upstream geometric stripper is unsafe (it deletes body
  text from multi-column documents) — see
  [docs/followups-pdf-oxide-swap.md](followups-pdf-oxide-swap.md) §2a. **10. Feed sources are exempt
  from the delete-sweep — there is no entry pruning.** A feed exposes only its most recent entries,
  so an entry falling out of the feed does not mean it was deleted upstream: treating it as a delete
  would wipe most of a feed's indexed history on a normal fetch, and a feed `304` (or a transient
  empty parse) would zero out every entry in one sweep. The ingestion pipeline's delete-sweep
  therefore skips `ingestor_kind = feed` sources entirely — entries once indexed stay indexed
  indefinitely, even after they scroll off the feed, until the whole source is removed
  (`source remove`, which still cascades normally). Pruning truly-dead entry URLs (404/410) is a
  follow-up issue.

**11. Conditional-GET state (`ETag`/`Last-Modified`) is captured but never persisted or reused, for
both `url` and `feed` sources.** `external_etag` is captured on the `Resource` at fetch time but
nothing writes it back for reuse on the next fetch — every `localdb index` re-fetches every URL and
every feed entry in full, with no `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` sent. A follow-up issue covers
persisting and round-tripping conditional-GET state together with delete-on-404/410 pruning
(previous item).

**12. A store containing a `kind = 'feed'` source cannot be opened by an older binary that predates
the Feed ingestor.** `sources.ingestor_kind` decoding is a hard match over the known `IngestorKind`
variants ([specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §2); an unrecognized kind fails
the whole `list_sources`/`index` call for the store, not just the one source with that kind.
Concretely: add even one `kind = 'feed'` source to a store, and every older `localdb` binary whose
`IngestorKind` enum doesn't yet have `Feed` can no longer list or index _any_ source in that store —
not just the feed one — until it's upgraded. Adding a source kind is therefore a floor-version event
for a store, the same way a schema migration is, but with none of the migration framework's tooling
around it (there is no `db downgrade` for this — the incompatibility lives in a data row, not the
schema version). See [docs/migrations.md](migrations.md). Graceful degradation (skip unrecognized
kinds instead of hard-erroring the whole store) is a follow-up issue.

**13. Cross-source URL ownership: two sources claiming the same URL in one store can race, and the
loser's sweep deletes the other's live document.** Resource upsert keys off `(store_id, uri)` and
reassigns `source_id` to whichever source most recently ingested that URI; the delete-sweep runs
per-source, over the URIs that source saw this run. If two sources resolve to the same URL within
the same run window — e.g. a feed entry linking to a page that's also directly registered as a `url`
source — the resource can be silently reassigned between them, and the loser's next sweep, no longer
seeing that URI as "its own," deletes the shared, still-live document. This predates the feed
connector (it already applied to two `url` sources, or a `path`/`url` collision, sharing a URI) and
is not fixed by this work; the feed connector's discovery mode just makes the collision more likely
in practice, since feeds routinely link to pages users have also added directly.

**14. Feed `refresh` is accepted, persisted, and validated but does not do anything yet.** Same
story as `url`'s `refresh_interval_secs`: the value round-trips through config and the API but no
scheduler reads it back to trigger a re-fetch — scheduled refresh is daemon-side work not yet built
for either source kind.

**15. Enrichment metadata changes don't persist while content is unchanged.**
([#176](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/176)) The pipeline's incremental skip
(`core/src/ingestion.rs`, `on_resource`) returns on a `content_hash` + `policy_version` match before
any store write, and metadata is never compared — so corrected feed dates/authors/external ids (and
the feed-derived `modified_at`) never reach the store for an already-indexed document until its
content bytes change. Fixing this needs a core skip-contract change (metadata-aware compare, or a
metadata-only store update that skips re-embedding); see the issue for the design options.

This is format-general, not feed-specific. It equally covers a PDF whose Info dictionary or XMP is
corrected (`/Title`, `/Author`) and a Markdown file whose YAML front-matter changes: in both cases
the extracted blocks — and therefore `content_hash` — are byte-identical, so the resource is skipped
and the stored metadata stays stale. PDFs became a visible instance of it when PDF Dublin Core
extraction landed, but the skip contract, not the extractor, is the cause. Note the first index
after upgrading is unaffected: the extraction change moves every PDF's content hash anyway, so
metadata is written then.

**16. ~~`index_resource`'s zero-chunk arm still deletes on an empty replacement~~ — RESOLVED.**
([#185](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/185),
[#156](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/156)) `index_resource` now returns
`IndexOutcome::Empty` for a resource that chunks to nothing and deletes nothing — an invariant at
the sink rather than per-ingestor discipline. `FileIngestor` additionally classifies zero-block
extraction as `on_skipped(Other)`, matching `UrlIngestor`. At the source level,
`enumerate_path_source` distinguishes `PathEnumeration::RootUnavailable` from `Complete(vec![])`,
and the delete-sweep is suppressed both for an incomplete enumeration and for a run that observed
none of the source's own URIs. Deletion is also now opt-in (`--delete`). See
[specs/04-search-pipeline.md](../specs/04-search-pipeline.md) §1 for the full contract, and gaps 18
and 19 below for the retention trade-offs this deliberately accepts.

**17. There is no opt-in for private-network feed entry links.**
([#196](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/196)) Discovery mode fetches entry links through
a public-destination-only HTTP client (see [specs/02-domain-model.md](../specs/02-domain-model.md) §
"Feed connector", _Destination policy_), and v0.1 offers no way to relax that. An operator running
an internal feed whose entries link to LAN hosts gets those entries indexed from their embedded
summaries only — the linked pages are never fetched, silently from the operator's point of view
apart from a `WARN` log line. There is also a residual hole the guard deliberately does not close:
the **feed URL itself** uses the unrestricted client (it is operator-configured, the same trust
class as a `url` source), so a feed URL that 30x's to a private destination is still followed. A
per-source or global allow-private-destinations setting would address both at once — the opt-in and
the residual redirect risk — and is the shape the follow-up issue proposes.

A related feed-specific identity bug lives in the same family:
[#186](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/186) — an entry with no guid, no link and no
title gets a random UUID identity on every parse, so it is re-indexed and its previous copy
delete-swept on every run.

**18. A source that loses everything at once keeps its documents until it is re-created.** (accepted
trade-off of [#156](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/156)'s guard 2) The zero-seen
backstop cannot distinguish "the connector is broken" from "every document really was removed" —
both look like a run that observed none of the source's own URIs — and it resolves that ambiguity in
favor of retention. So a `path` source whose directory is legitimately emptied, or whose files are
all renamed in one run, keeps its now-stale documents even under `--delete`. The run warns loudly,
naming the source and the count, and the remedy is `localdb source remove` followed by `source add`
and a reindex. Chosen deliberately: the alternative is the failure mode that motivated the guard. A
future `--delete --force`, or a confirmation prompt showing the affected URIs, would give the escape
hatch without weakening the default.

**19. A file legitimately emptied keeps its previous content indexed.** (accepted trade-off of
[#185](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/185)'s sink invariant) `index_resource` refuses
to delete on an empty replacement, because it cannot tell a file that is now genuinely blank from
one whose extraction failed to produce anything this run. Truncating a file to zero bytes therefore
leaves its old content searchable, and the run reports it as skipped. The escape hatch is clean and
needs no new surface: delete the file, and the sweep removes it normally under `--delete`.

## Deferred design decisions {#design-decisions}

Several items surfaced during the v0.1.0 issue sweep require cross-cutting design decisions before
code can be written. They are documented (with options and recommendations) in
[docs/design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md):

- **A7**: `policy_version` does not hash resolved per-source chunking parameters.
- **A8 / B4**: Pagination offset computed but never applied; `total_candidates` is pre-dedup.
- **B2**: Cross-store deduplication semantics (collapse vs. distinct citations).
- **B3**: Rerank seam re-attaches store metadata by index position (safe today, unsafe with real
  reranker).
- **E1**: Structured MCP tool results (spec-decided, implementation deferred to v0.2.0).
- **A9-charset**: Allowed character set for store names beyond traversal-safety.
