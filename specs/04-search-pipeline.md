# Spec 04 — Ingestion & Retrieval Pipeline

> Status: accepted draft, 2026-06-30.

Pipeline: **acquire → extract → blocks → chunks → embed → index** (write side), and **query → BM25 +
dense → RRF fuse → filter → citations** (read side).

## 1. Acquisition

Acquisition is driven by **ingestors** (`Ingestor` trait in `core`). The ingestor kind determines
how content reaches the pipeline and what kind of Resource it produces.

### Ingestor kinds

- **`file` ingestor:** Scans paths on demand (`localdb index`); the daemon additionally watches
  continuously via `notify` (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux), with debounce so editor
  save-storms coalesce. Include/exclude globs from the source spec. Runs the parser chain on each
  file, receives a `ParsedDocument`, and converts it to a `Resource` with typed blocks via
  `markdown_to_blocks()`. The parser chain is an implementation detail of this ingestor, not a
  top-level pipeline concept.
- **`url` ingestor:** HTTP fetch; runs the same parser chain (readability-style main-content
  extraction → Markdown); converts `ParsedDocument` to a `Resource` with blocks via
  `markdown_to_blocks()`. Conditional GET (ETag/Last-Modified) when available. Refreshes on the
  configured interval (daemon) or on explicit `localdb index` (embedded).
- **Future ingestors** (notion, telegram, signal, email, transcription, feed): produce `Resource`
  objects directly with native block types (e.g. `Message`, `Segment`, `Attachment`), bypassing the
  parser chain entirely. The `Ingestor` trait's contract is to deliver a `Resource`; how it gets
  there is ingestor-internal.

### Incremental re-index

A resource is re-processed only when its `content_hash` changes. `content_hash` is a blake3 hash of
the ordered canonical texts of all blocks in the resource (not a hash of a Markdown string).
Unchanged → skip; changed → replace-by-URI: the old resource's chunks/blocks/resource row are
deleted AND the new ones (new content-addressed IDs, [02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §3)
are inserted in a **single atomic store transaction**. A write failure during the replace (e.g. an
embedding or constraint error) leaves the old resource intact and searchable — the store never
observes a state where the old chunks are gone but the new ones failed to land.

Resources also carry:

- **`external_etag`:** for URL sources, the server-supplied ETag or Last-Modified value; used for
  conditional GET to avoid re-fetching unchanged content.
- **`extractor_version`:** a version stamp on the parser/block-conversion logic. When parser or
  `markdown_to_blocks()` logic improves, bumping `extractor_version` enables selective reprocessing
  of resources whose content has not changed but whose block representation may improve (without a
  full policy-version reindex).

### Deletes

Deletes are data-modifying: ≥ 90% coverage gate ([01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) §7).

**Deletion is opt-in.** `localdb index` removes nothing; `localdb index --delete` does, following
`rsync --delete`. A retaining run reports what pruning would have removed
(`IngestionResult.docs_prunable`) so nothing goes silently stale. Two reasons for the default:
removal is asymmetric (a wrong delete costs a full re-index, a missed one costs a stale hit —
[#156](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/156) cost ~4.4M chunks), and retention is often
what's actually wanted — a local copy of a newspaper article that has since 404'd is _more_ valuable
for having outlived its origin.

Under `--delete`, two paths remove documents, and the distinction between them governs everything
below: **knowing a resource is gone is not the same as failing to find it.**

**Confirmed gone → deleted unconditionally.** An ingestor that positively establishes a locator no
longer exists at the origin (HTTP 404/410 after retry) reports it via `IngestCallback::on_gone`. The
origin was reached and answered; nothing is inferred, so no guard applies and the feed exemption
below does not either. An ingestor that merely _fails to observe_ a locator must not use this hook.

**Presumed gone → the guarded delete-sweep.** A resource stays alive across a run if it is observed
via **either** `on_resource` or `on_skipped`; the sweep removes a URI that neither hook reported.
`on_skipped` takes an already-canonical `Uri`, the same representation `on_resource`'s
`Resource.uri` carries, so both hooks populate the "seen" set in one consistent key space. Because
this infers deletion from absence, it runs only where the absence is informative:

- **Feed sources are exempt entirely.** A feed exposes a bounded window of recent entries, so an
  entry's absence means "it scrolled off," not "it was deleted."
- **Guard 1 — incomplete enumeration.** An ingestor that could not observe its source reports
  `IngestResult.enumeration = Enumeration::Incomplete { reason }`; `enumerate_path_source` returns
  `PathEnumeration::RootUnavailable` for a root that does not exist (an unmounted volume), distinct
  from `Complete(vec![])` for a root that exists and is empty. Incomplete ⇒ no sweep.
- **Guard 2 — zero-seen backstop.** A source that owns previously indexed URIs and observed none of
  them this run does not sweep, whatever the ingestor claims. Source-shape-agnostic, so it also
  covers connectors that cannot detect their own incompleteness. It does not subsume guard 1: a
  connector that enumerates 3 of 500 items before failing has a non-empty seen set, so only guard 1
  protects the other 497.

Both suppressions log a warning naming the source, the reason, and the number of documents
preserved. **Retention trade-off:** a source whose contents really were all removed at once keeps
its documents until the source is removed and re-added — accepted deliberately, and stated in the
warning.

At the resource level the same rule is a **sink invariant**: `index_resource` never deletes on an
empty replacement. A resource that chunks to nothing returns `IndexOutcome::Empty` — nothing
written, nothing deleted — and the pipeline records it as a skip without touching `DocumentIndex`.
Ingestors should still classify "extracted to nothing" as unusable and report it via `on_skipped`
(`FileIngestor` and `UrlIngestor` both do), but that is defense in depth; the guarantee lives at the
sink, where no ingestor can bypass it. **Retention trade-off:** a file legitimately emptied keeps
its previous content indexed. The escape hatch already exists — delete the file, and the sweep
removes it normally under `--delete`.

[#156](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/156) (source level, zero URIs enumerated) and
[#185](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/issues/185) (resource level, zero blocks extracted) are
one conflation — "unavailable" mistaken for "legitimately empty" — one layer apart.

## 2. Extraction (v1 matrix)

The parser chain is an implementation detail of the `file` and `url` ingestors. Parsers still return
a `ParsedDocument` (Markdown string + title + `DocumentMetadata`), which the ingestor then converts
to a `Resource` with typed blocks via `markdown_to_blocks()`. Future ingestors that natively produce
structured content may emit blocks directly without going through a Markdown intermediate.

#### PDF extraction is tuned for retrieval, not for visual fidelity

A PDF is converted one page at a time and the pages are concatenated, recording the byte offset
where each page begins so blocks can carry a `page` number (§2 of
[02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md)). Four deliberate deviations from the extractor's defaults,
plus three local repairs, exist because the goal is the words an author wrote — not a faithful
reproduction of the printed page:

- **Artifacts are dropped** (`/Artifact`-tagged running headers, footers, page-number folios and
  watermarks, per ISO 32000-1 §14.8.2.2.1). Without this, a folio becomes its own chunk.
- **Ligatures are expanded** (U+FB00–U+FB06 → `fi`/`fl`/`ff`/…), so BM25 tokenization and the
  embedder see real words.
- **Soft hyphens (U+00AD) are deleted.** They are discretionary line-break hints with no textual
  meaning (§14.8.2.2.3). Deletion alone reconstructs the word; line-break hyphens are deliberately
  _not_ rejoined, as that is where `well-being` → `wellbeing` corruption comes from.
- **Pages with no text layer are dropped, not annotated.** A page that yields nothing contributes
  nothing; the whole set is reported once via a `WARN` naming the count and page ranges. A _mixed_
  document — real text on some pages, bare scans on others — still indexes its text. This is what
  keeps the "scanned PDFs are rejected, OCR is out of scope" statement below honest: previously a
  placeholder marker was emitted per skipped page and indexed as though it were content, which also
  let mixed documents evade scanned-PDF detection entirely.
- **Heading and code-block inference is guarded.** The extractor infers headings from font
  clustering and code blocks from monospace detection; both over-fire on real books. A heading that
  fails a sanity check is demoted to a paragraph (it stays indexed — it just stops becoming a
  `heading_path` breadcrumb for every following chunk), and a bare fence whose content reads as
  prose is un-fenced. Both guards are biased hard against false positives.

Geometric stripping of running headers in _untagged_ PDFs is **not** enabled: the upstream
implementation matches glyph-run spans rather than lines and deletes body text from multi-column
documents. See `docs/followups-pdf-oxide-swap.md`.

**Out of scope (explicit):** OCR / scanned PDFs and images. EPUB is the only ebook format supported;
**MOBI/AZW/AZW3** (PalmDOC/KF8 compression, frequent DRM — realistically need a Calibre shell-out)
and **FB2/CBZ** (on `rbook`'s roadmap, not yet implemented) are deferred. Rationale and the full
deferred list: [06-roadmap.md](06-roadmap.md) §5. Unsupported files are skipped and counted in
IndexJob stats, not errors.

**XLSX/XLS explicitly disabled:** Despite anytomd supporting XLSX/XLS in principle, extraction for
these formats is disabled in `OfficeParser` pending an upstream performance fix.
`anytomd::convert_bytes` on an 87K-row XLSX (6.9 MB) took >16 minutes in production (vs. <1 s for
the equivalent CSV). The file is counted as `unsupported_format`, not an error. Use CSV export as a
workaround. Tracking: <https://github.com/developer0hye/anytomd-rs/issues/94>

**Extension-gated acceptance:** The `PlaintextParser` (and by extension the full parser chain) only
accepts files whose extension or basename matches the list published by
`extract::supported_extensions()` (text and code/data extensions, plus known lockfile basenames such
as `Cargo.lock`). Files with unknown or binary extensions — `.exe`, `.png`, `.bin`, etc. — are
declined at the parser level and counted as `unsupported_format` in `IndexJobStats` without ever
entering the chunker or embedder. This prevents indexing hangs caused by chunkers receiving
arbitrarily large binary blobs.

**Default include allowlist for directory sources:** When a `path` source points to a directory and
no explicit `include` globs have been set, `cli` automatically applies `DEFAULT_PATH_INCLUDES` — a
glob list derived from `extract::supported_extensions()` — so that file-system enumeration skips
unsupported files before they ever reach the extraction layer. Single-file sources are not affected
(they carry an exact filename glob). Sources added via explicit `include` override this default
entirely.

**Three-way per-document classification:**

| Outcome                                               | Error variant                   | Counter                    | Behavior                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Format not handled (e.g. scanned PDF, binary `.html`) | `UnsupportedFormat`             | `unsupported_format_count` | Silent; no WARN.                          |
| Supported format, broken instance (e.g. corrupt DOCX) | `ExtractionFailed`              | `error_count`              | WARN logged per file; counted as failure. |
| Unexpected panic in parser/chunker                    | `Internal` (via `catch_unwind`) | `error_count`              | WARN logged per file; counted as failure. |

In all three cases the ingestion loop continues with the next file; the process does **not** abort.

Exactly one WARN is emitted per failing resource. `core::ingestion` owns that line — it is the layer
that accounts for ingestion outcomes — so ingestors log their extra framing at `debug!` and fold
anything the operator needs at default level (e.g. that the failure was a _panic_ rather than a
returned error) into the `SkipReason::Error` payload itself.

**Partial success is a fourth, orthogonal case.** A document can extract successfully and still lose
content: a PDF whose text layer covers only some pages contributes nothing for the rest. That is
`Ok` — the document indexes, and counts as a success — but `extract` emits one WARN naming how many
pages were dropped and which. It is deliberately not an error variant: a mixed scanned/text book
must still be indexed for the text it does have.

**`--strict` opt-in:** by default `index` is best-effort (exits `0` regardless of per-file
failures). Pass `--strict` to exit `2` after the run completes when `error_count > 0`. Unsupported
files do not trigger `--strict`; only `ExtractionFailed` / `Internal` errors do.

**Binary / non-UTF-8 input:** All parser implementations (`MarkdownParser`, `HtmlParser`,
`PlaintextParser`) decline non-UTF-8 bytes by returning `Ok(None)` rather than
`Err(InvalidRequest)`. A file with a recognized extension that contains binary or mis-encoded bytes
therefore falls through the entire parser chain and is counted as `unsupported_format` in
`IndexJobStats`, not as an error.

**Per-document panic isolation:** `index_document` wraps the synchronous extraction and chunking
calls in `std::panic::catch_unwind`. Any unexpected panic in a parser or chunker is caught,
converted to `Err(Error::Internal)`, logged as a per-file WARN, and counted in `error_count`. The
ingestion loop continues with the next file; the process does not abort.

## 3. Chunking

Chunking operates on **blocks**, not on a raw Markdown string. Each resource carries an ordered
sequence of typed blocks; the chunker dispatches on `BlockKind` to produce block-appropriate chunks.

### Block-dispatch rules

| Block kinds                                       | Chunker             | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Heading`, `Text`                                 | prose chunker       | `MarkdownSplitter` subdivides within the block on semantic boundaries (sentences, words); target ≈ 256 tokens, overlap ≈ 0 tokens.                                              |
| `Code`                                            | code chunker        | Line-based subdivision within the block; target ≈ 60 lines.                                                                                                                     |
| `Message`, `Segment`                              | messages chunker    | Multi-block windowed: sliding window over consecutive Message/Segment blocks (see below).                                                                                       |
| `Table`                                           | table chunker       | Row-based packing: rows are packed into chunks under the token target; every chunk re-emits the header row and separator so each chunk is a standalone valid table (see below). |
| `Reference`, `Attachment`, `Frontmatter`, `Image` | one chunk per block | These block types are typically small; no further subdivision.                                                                                                                  |

The source-level preset (from config or the `--preset` CLI flag) acts as a hint for ambiguous cases;
block-kind dispatch takes precedence for unambiguous kinds.

**Invariant:** chunks never cross block boundaries, EXCEPT message-window chunks, which explicitly
span multiple consecutive `Message`/`Segment` blocks. This invariant makes `heading_path`
attribution deterministic (see below) and ensures context-expansion queries are well-defined.

**Coarse `Text` blocks:** `markdown_to_blocks` emits **one** `Text` block per run of consecutive
running-text content — paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, HTML blocks — between structural boundaries
(a `Heading`, a `Table`/`Code`/`Image` block, or the start/end of the document). Block sizing is
therefore purely structural, driven by element boundaries, not by a token target; the prose chunker
restores token-sizing by splitting a `Text` block into one or more prose chunks via
`MarkdownSplitter`. This is what lets prose chunks approach the ~256-token target instead of
producing one tiny chunk per paragraph (the #158 fix) — a multi-paragraph run of running text is
chunked together, not paragraph-by-paragraph. **Headings remain discrete blocks and are still
chunked** — a `Heading` block is never folded into an adjacent `Text` run, because it feeds the
contextual embedder's document context and `heading_path` attribution (see below). Filtering
headings out of _search results_ is a separate, future search-side concern, not a chunking-time
decision.

### heading_path attribution

`heading_path` is derived from the block tree: heading blocks that precede a content block in the
resource's ordered block sequence are collected into the path for all chunks produced from that
content block. There is no re-parsing of Markdown — the heading structure comes directly from the
block representation.

### Source preset override

`IngestionConfig` carries a `source_preset` field (`prose` (default) | `code` | `messages`),
resolved from the source's config (the source-level `preset` key, [03-config.md](03-config.md) §2)
or the CLI's `--preset` flag. Per-file automatic preset routing — `preset_for`, which inspects a
resource's `uri` and `mime` hint to route e.g. JSON/YAML/lockfiles to the `code` preset — applies
**only** when the source preset is the default `prose`. An explicit `code` or `messages` source
preset is authoritative and wins over per-file detection: a source configured as `code` chunks every
file in it with the code chunker regardless of what `preset_for` would otherwise guess, and likewise
a `messages` source always uses the messages chunker. This preserves useful per-file auto-detection
for the common (prose) case while giving explicit non-default presets full, unambiguous control —
needed for message/transcript sources where `preset_for`'s filename/mime heuristics do not apply.

### Messages chunker

The `messages` preset is implemented as a sliding window over `Message`/`Segment` blocks:

- **`window_turns`** (default 6): number of consecutive turns per chunk.
- **`stride_turns`** (default 3): step between windows.
- Windows are additionally bounded by token count so that no single chunk exceeds the embedding
  model's context limit.
- Each window chunk carries the `heading_path` of the containing thread/resource.
- **`window_block_seqs`:** each window chunk records the `block_seq` of every member block it spans
  in its `location` (`location_json = {start, end, window_block_seqs?}`), not just the denormalized
  `block_seq` of its first member — so context-expansion and `get_chunks` consumers can resolve
  every block a multi-block chunk touches.
- **Chunk ids after fix-up:** chunk ids are computed **after** the window fix-up pass (the pass that
  shrinks a window from the end to fit the token budget, or to keep the last window from running
  past the end of the turn sequence — see `chunk_messages`) — so the content-addressed id (§4 below;
  [02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §3) reflects the window's final membership, not a
  pre-fix-up candidate window.

### Table chunker

`Table` blocks are chunked by a dedicated row-based packer, not routed through the code chunker:

- Rows are packed greedily into successive chunks, filling each chunk up to the (prose) token
  target.
- Every chunk re-emits the table's header row and the `|---|` separator row, so each chunk is a
  valid, independently renderable Markdown table — a chunk is never dependent on a sibling chunk to
  parse correctly.
- **Oversized single row:** a single data row that alone exceeds the token target cannot be packed
  into a standalone valid chunk at the target size; it falls back to `chunk_code`'s long-line split
  (see below), preserving the invariant that no single chunk grows unbounded.

### Prose chunker details

Chunk sizing for `prose` is **token-accurate**, measured using the embedding model's own tokenizer
(the default model `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` supports up to 32K tokens; localdb caps its
late-chunking window at 4096 tokens = 16 × 256-token chunks). When no local tokenizer is available
(e.g. hosted/API embedders), it falls back to a character approximation (~4 chars/token). The
256-token / 0-overlap defaults mirror the contextual late-chunking model's training regime:
Perplexity's contextualized-embeddings model is trained on documents partitioned into 256-token
chunks (16 chunks per 4096-token document) with **no** intra-document overlap, because late chunking
shares context across chunks from the same document (chunks must be sent in source-document order)
and so supplies cross-chunk context itself. Aligning the chunker to that regime gives smaller,
precise chunks — better citation granularity — while the model handles cross-chunk context, with no
overlap needed. These are defaults to beat with evaluation, not dogma.

**`chunk_prose` structureless fallback:** Before invoking `MarkdownSplitter`, `chunk_prose` runs two
O(n) probes over the block; tripping either delegates the whole block to the `code` chunker so the
content is still indexed in bounded chunks:

- **Quality probe:** longest whitespace-free run > `STRUCTURELESS_RUN_MULTIPLIER` (8) × the target.
  An ordinary paragraph or long-lined prose block in a whitespace-delimited script has plenty of
  internal whitespace and stays on the prose path; genuinely structureless content (minified JSON, a
  lockfile) does not (#191, #192).
- **Performance guard:** longest _line_ > `OVERLONG_LINE_MULTIPLIER` (64) × the target, whitespace
  or not. `MarkdownSplitter`'s split-point search is super-linear on a single flat line, so a
  pathologically long line (hundreds of KB with no newlines) must not reach it — the
  multi-minute-hang class the fallback was originally introduced for (#61). Real prose paragraphs,
  even the single-line ones EPUB/HTML extraction emits, stay far below this cap.

Both probes compare a _char_ count against the target, which in production is a _token_ count from
the embedder's tokenizer — a deliberate heuristic, not an exact unit match. The chars-per-token
ratio is tokenizer-dependent: for whitespace-delimited text it is ≥ 1, so the probes trip no later
than a true token measure would; BPE tokenizers can emit multiple tokens per char on CJK and rare
scripts, inverting the direction — an accepted imprecision for content already covered by the CJK
limitation above. Known limitation: scripts without inter-word whitespace (CJK, Thai, …) make a
whole paragraph one "run", so long CJK prose trips the quality probe and gets char-aligned cuts in
the `code` chunker; proper word segmentation is out of scope.

**`chunk_code` long-line split:** `chunk_code` enforces a per-line char limit. Lines exceeding the
limit are hard-split into target-sized pieces, preventing single-line binary or minified content
from producing unbounded chunk sizes. Each cut prefers the last whitespace inside the window over
the raw char boundary — as long as backing off to it still leaves a piece more than half the window
— so ordinary long-lined prose splits between words instead of mid-word; content with no whitespace
in the window (base64, URLs) still gets the hard char cut (#191).

### Spreadsheet routing

Spreadsheet formats (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) route to the code chunker. These files produce extracted text
that is dense tabular content (similar to CSV), so the fast line-based chunker is used instead of
the prose splitter to avoid hangs on large tables. Note: XLSX/XLS extraction is currently disabled
(see §2), so this routing is moot until the upstream fix lands.

## 4. Embedding

### Document-aware interface

**Decision:** the `Embedder` trait in `core` receives **chunks grouped by resource, with resource
and block context** — not a flat list of strings:

```
embed_documents(docs: [{document_context, chunks: [chunk_text, ...]}, ...])
    -> [[vector, ...], ...]
```

"Document context" for embedding is constructed from the resource's block sequence. Concretely, an
embedding renderer may serialize nearby blocks into a Markdown-like context string as an
implementation detail — the trait shape is stable regardless of how context is assembled. Classic
per-chunk embedding is the degenerate case (context ignored, one chunk per call batch).
**Rationale:** contextualized/late-chunking models need the surrounding document to embed each
chunk; retrofitting a flat trait later would touch every call site. The message-store case (thread
as context for each turn window) is the same shape ([02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §5).
**Rejected:** flat `embed(texts) -> vectors` trait — locks the architecture to context-free
embedding.

Models are **downloaded on first run** (with progress UI, checksum verification, resumable) into the
model cache ([03-config.md](03-config.md) §4) — never bundled into the binary.

### Local backends: ONNX (CPU) and CoreML (ANE/GPU)

The default `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` runs on two interchangeable local backends, selected by the
`local` / `local-coreml` / `local-onnx` provider values ([03-config.md](03-config.md) §7).

- **ONNX (CPU):** the reference path. Late-chunking is run in `embed`: the model emits token
  embeddings, then Rust does mean-pooling over each chunk's token span and `tanh` int8 quantization
  before binarization.
- **CoreML (ANE/GPU):** macOS-only, behind the opt-in `local-coreml` cargo feature (requires Rust ≥
  1.85, subsumed by the workspace's 1.88 floor). Executes on Apple Silicon's ANE/GPU via
  `objc2-core-ml`. Pooling and `tanh` int8 quantization happen **inside the model** — it consumes a
  `pool_matrix` input and outputs int8 `(32, 1024)` directly, so the in-Rust mean-pool + quant of
  the ONNX path is not needed. The CoreML bundle is the context (late-chunking) variant, downloaded
  from HF repo `dokterbob/pplx-embed-coreml` (pinned revision) via `hf-hub` 1.0, whose built-in XET
  transfers deduplicate the shared ~1.15 GB encoder weights across sequence-length buckets. Buckets
  are fixed ANE sequence lengths `L ∈ {512, 1024, 2048, 4096}` (whichever are published — currently
  only `context/L512-int8`) plus an optional dynamic GPU catch-all.

Both backends are **index-interchangeable**: same `model_id`, 1024-dim, `Binary` encoding,
sign-compatible vectors. Measured on Apple Silicon (CoreML fp16/ANE vs ONNX fp32/CPU on identical
chunks): **cosine parity ~0.995–0.9995** (the full-precision direction is essentially identical),
and **per-dimension sign/Hamming agreement ~98–99%** (0.982–0.994 observed). The few flips (~5–11 of
1024 dims) are dimensions whose pre-tanh value sits within fp16-rounding distance of zero and so
round to a different int8 sign at the tie point — they carry negligible magnitude. An index built by
one backend is queryable by the other with no reindex (the choice of backend does not affect
`policy_version`); cross-backend Hamming distances carry ~1–2% backend-induced bit noise on
near-zero dimensions, which is small relative to inter-document distances.

### Gating benchmark for the default model

Before `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` is confirmed as default, measure on a mid-range laptop (Apple
Silicon, 16 GB): index a ~2 000-file / ~100 MB mixed corpus. **Gate:** sustained ≥ 15 chunks/s
end-to-end and first-index ≤ 30 min; if missed, the bge-small-class preset becomes the default and
the 0.6b model the opt-in quality preset. Either outcome is config, not architecture.

### Policy versioning

`policy_version = hash(canonical serialization of the store's effective {chunking, embedding, parsers})`.
Stored on every chunk. On store open / config change, if the effective policy hash differs from the
indexed one, the store is marked stale and a reindex job is created (daemon: automatic; embedded: on
next `localdb index`, with a warning from `status`). Chunker, embedder, and parser list change
**together** — there is no partial invalidation ([03-config.md](03-config.md) §2). The `parsers`
list is hashed **order-sensitively** (unlike `chunking`/`embedding`, which use order-independent key
serialization), so reordering parsers alone marks the store stale and schedules a reindex.

The `chunking` sub-policy embeds a chunking algorithm identifier as part of what gets hashed;
bumping it forces a reindex even when no user-visible config field changed. Current value:
**`textsplitter-md-v6`** (bumped from `v5`). The `v6` bump covers the mid-word-split fix (#191,
#192): `chunk_prose`'s structureless backstop is now dual-condition — longest whitespace-free run >
8× target (quality) or longest line > 64× target (performance guard, replacing the old 8× line
probe) — and `chunk_code`'s overlong-line hard-split now backs off to the last whitespace in the
window (falling back to the char cut only when the window has no whitespace) — chunk boundaries
change for long single-line prose, so existing stores reindex on the next `localdb index`. The `v5`
bump covers the coarse `Text` block ontology — `markdown_to_blocks` now emits one `Text` block per
run of consecutive running-text content, so prose chunks pack toward the ~256-token target instead
of one-tiny-chunk-per- paragraph (§3 above, "Coarse `Text` blocks"; the #158 fix), silently altering
chunk boundaries. The prior `v4` bump (from `v3`) covered two changes at once: the new `Chunk.id`
formula — `blake3(resource_id ‖ block_seq ‖ chunk_text ‖ seq_in_block)`
([02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §2, Chunk) — and the addition of the table chunker. Any of
these changes alone would silently alter chunk boundaries and/or ids without a policy bump,
defeating incremental re-index's staleness detection.

`content_hash` is a blake3 hash of the ordered canonical texts of all blocks in a resource (not of a
Markdown string). `extractor_version` on resources enables selective reprocessing when parser or
`markdown_to_blocks()` logic improves, without requiring a full policy-version reindex.

## 5. Retrieval

**Decision:** hybrid **BM25 + dense, fused with RRF** (k = 60), implemented **in our code** above
the `RetrievalStore` trait: query both legs (top-K each, default K = 50), fuse, then shape results.

**Rationale:** hybrid-by-default is a day-one requirement; RRF is robust, parameter-light, and
score-scale-free. Owning fusion keeps it identical across future backends. **Rejected:** score
interpolation (needs per-model calibration); backend-native fusion (backend-dependent behavior).

- **Filtering:** store filter (one, several, or all stores). Multi-store queries fan out per-store
  BM25 + dense queries, then pool each leg's results across all queried stores into one globally
  rank-ordered list _before_ a single RRF pass runs over the two pooled legs — never per-store RRF
  followed by a merge, which would let every store's local rank-0 chunk tie regardless of true
  quality (RRF scores are rank-based and scale-free). Fusion identity is the composite
  `(store_id, chunk_id)`, not `chunk_id` alone: chunk IDs are content-addressed
  ([02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §2), so the same document indexed into two stores yields
  the same chunk_id in both — a `chunk_id`-only key would silently merge two stores' distinct hits.
  Ties are broken deterministically: `fused_score` descending, then `store_id` ascending, then
  `chunk_id` ascending. Metadata filters (mime, path prefix, fetched_at range) are pushed down to
  the backend where supported.

  **Known limitation — cross-store score comparability.** Pooling ranks each leg by its raw backend
  score, which assumes every store queried together reports that leg's scores on the same scale. Two
  ways that assumption is imperfect:
  - **BM25** scores are corpus-relative (per-store IDF and average document length), so a pooled
    BM25 ranking compares numbers that are not strictly commensurable even when every store runs the
    same backend. Cross-store ordering within that leg is therefore approximate.
  - **Dense** scores land in `[0, 1]`, but not via one common mapping. `store-libsql` converts
    distance to score two ways, chosen per store by the encoding its embedder produced: `1 - d/2`
    from a continuous cosine distance (`VectorEncoding::Float32`), and `1 - d/nbits` from a
    sign-only binarized Hamming distance (`VectorEncoding::Binary`) — the latter being what the
    default `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` emits. Same range, different distributions, so pooling
    across a Binary-encoded and a Float32-encoded store would favor whichever mapping runs hotter
    rather than whichever store is more relevant. The two shipped models differ in dimensionality
    (1024 vs 384) so one query cannot currently reach both, but nothing enforces that. Separately,
    `SearchResult.score` documents the leg as "cosine/dot-product": an unbounded dot-product would
    swamp a bounded score outright, and is in any case wrong for the default model, whose vectors
    are unnormalized and which documents cosine as required. Dense scores must be a bounded
    similarity in `[0, 1]` — a precondition of pooling, not a free choice.

  Global pooling is still strictly better than per-store RRF, which gave _every_ store's local
  rank-0 chunk an identical score regardless of quality. But multi-store relevance is not fully
  solved until both legs are calibrated. Tracked by issue #40; see also §"Rejected" above on score
  interpolation.

- **Result shaping:** top-N (default 10) → Citation objects
  ([02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) §6), with per-leg scores retained for debugging
  (`score: {fused, dense, bm25}`). Citations carry a **block reference** and chunk position within
  that block, not just a Markdown span.
- **Reranking: explicitly post-MVP** ([06-roadmap.md](06-roadmap.md) §5). The pipeline leaves a seam
  (rerank stage between fuse and shape) but ships nothing.
- Query rewriting and answer generation are **not** backend-core concerns — they belong to
  downstream consumers (agents, future UI). URL/image as _query_ modes: out of scope v1.

### Context expansion

Context expansion is a first-class retrieval capability, available after initial ranking:

- **Neighboring chunks in the same block:** retrieve the chunks immediately before and after a
  result chunk within the same block, to provide sentence-level continuity.
- **Nearby blocks in the same resource:** retrieve adjacent blocks (by block tree position) in the
  same resource, for section-level context.
- **Full resource block sequence:** retrieve all blocks from a resource in order, for document-level
  context (e.g. for a summarization or answer-synthesis consumer).

Context expansion is exposed as explicit query operations, not applied automatically to search
results.

### Dense search (DiskANN / libsql)

**Decision:** the store backend is libsql (Turso's SQLite fork) with built-in vector search. Dense
vectors are stored as `F32_BLOB` (float32) or `F1BIT_BLOB` (binary) column types, with DiskANN
indexing via `libsql_vector_idx`.

- **Float32 path:** embedding column is `F32_BLOB(dim)`. Search via
  `vector_top_k(table, col, query_blob, k)` which uses the DiskANN index automatically. Score
  conversion: cosine distance → score via `1.0 - distance / 2.0 ∈ [0, 1]`.
- **Binary path:** when the embedder's `vector_encoding()` returns `Binary`, the store writes an
  `F1BIT_BLOB(dim)` column. Binarization: `bit = (x ≥ 0.0)`, packed MSB-first (dim 0 → bit 7 of byte
  0). A 1024-dim float vector becomes 128 bytes. Search uses Hamming distance. Score formula:
  `1.0 − hamming_dist / nbits ∈ [0, 1]`.
- **Index maintenance:** DiskANN indexes are auto-maintained by libsql — no manual
  `create_vector_index` calls are needed. The index is created implicitly when `vector_top_k` is
  first used.
- **BM25 via FTS5:** full-text search uses libsql's FTS5 extension with `bm25()` scoring. FTS5
  indexes are auto-maintained — no manual `create_fts_index` calls. The FTS5 virtual table is
  created alongside the chunks table and kept in sync via triggers.
- **Supported embedders:** pplx local-ONNX models (`pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`,
  `pplx-embed-v1-0.6b`) override `vector_encoding()` to return `Binary`. `FakeEmbedder` keeps
  `Float32`.
- **Expected recall drop (binary):** ~2–4 pts on MTEB-ML vs float32 at 1024 dim; cushioned by the
  BM25+RRF hybrid. Future rerank via an int8 copy can recover the gap.

#### Index tuning and the per-chunk cost model

libsql stores every DiskANN node as a **fixed-size** blob, allocated with
`sqlite3_bind_zeroblob(..., nBlockSize)` regardless of the node's actual degree. So the index has an
exact, unavoidable per-chunk cost:

```
block_size = (node_vec_size + 16) + max_neighbors × (edge_vec_size + 16)
```

`max_neighbors` multiplies the edge width, which makes `compress_neighbors` the single largest lever
on total database size. Hence the invariant:

> **`compress_neighbors` must never be wider than the embedding column's own encoding.** It is a
> _compression_ only relative to a wider node vector. Against a narrower one it is an inflation that
> buys no recall.

Violating that invariant is what produced issue #179 (45 GB for ~600k chunks whose raw vectors are
under 1 GB) and issue #177. `compress_neighbors=float8` was chosen in PR #92 while a float32 column
was in play, and was not revisited when the binary column landed. On an `F1BIT_BLOB` column libsql
converts each source bit to `±1` and quantizes _that_ to a byte, so every one of those 1032 edge
bytes held only 0 or 255 — 8× the space for exactly the information the 128-byte node vector already
carried, and therefore zero recall benefit. Pinning `max_neighbors=64` compounded it by overriding
libsql's own guard rail, which caps edge overhead at 50× node overhead.

Measured per-chunk cost at 1024 dimensions (read back from `libsql_vector_meta_shadow`, not derived
— see `store-libsql/tests/vector_index_cost.rs`):

| Column       | `compress_neighbors` | `max_neighbors`        | Bytes/chunk | 600k chunks |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `F1BIT_BLOB` | _(none — schema v6)_ | _(libsql default: 51)_ | **7,488**   | **4.5 GB**  |
| `F1BIT_BLOB` | `float8` (schema v5) | 64                     | 67,216      | 40.3 GB     |
| `F32_BLOB`   | `float8`             | 64                     | 71,184      | 42.7 GB     |
| `F32_BLOB`   | _(none)_             | _(libsql default: 51)_ | 213,824     | 128 GB      |

The tuning is therefore **encoding-dependent**, and derived in exactly one place (`store-libsql`'s
`vectors::vector_index_params`): binary columns pass `metric=cosine` alone, while float32 columns
keep both parameters, because for a 4 KiB node vector `float8` edges are a genuine 4× compression
and the bare default would be 3× _worse_.

**Recall.** Dropping `compress_neighbors` is lossless by construction: libsql converts a 1-bit
source to float8 by mapping each bit to `±1` and quantizing, giving exactly byte 0 or 255, so the
float8 cosine distance is an exact zero-intercept linear rescaling of Hamming distance
(`F8_distance = (2/dims) × Hamming`). RobustPrune's keep/drop decision is a _ratio_ between two
distances computed the same way, so it is invariant to the substitution. Dropping `max_neighbors` is
a real change — degree 64 → 51, with no compensating change to the search beam
(`insert_l`/`search_l` are fixed constants, unrelated to `max_neighbors`) — so it was measured, not
argued: 6,000 clustered 1024-bit vectors, 200 held-out queries, recall@10 against exact brute-force
ground truth, **6 independent index builds per configuration**:

| Configuration     | mean recall@10 | sd     | min    | max    |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| v5 (`float8`, 64) | 0.5714         | 0.1164 | 0.3190 | 0.6625 |
| v6 (1-bit, 51)    | 0.5792         | 0.0609 | 0.5085 | 0.6695 |

The difference in means is 0.15 standard errors — no detectable regression, and v6 is nominally
better with half the variance.

Schema v6 (`shrink_vector_index`) rebuilds an existing binary index into the new shape. The rebuild
reads `chunks.embedding` directly — **no re-embedding and no model download** — but it is a DiskANN
insert per chunk, so it is a long operation on a large store. The freed pages land on SQLite's
freelist, so the file does not shrink until `localdb db vacuum` runs; this is why the `VACUUM`
attempted in #177, _before_ any rebuild had freed anything, correctly reclaimed nothing.
