# Spec 02 — Canonical Domain Model

> Status: accepted draft, revised 2026-08-11. All entities live in the `core` crate and are shared
> by every surface. Field lists are normative for meaning, not for exact Rust types.
>
> **Supersedes:** the Markdown-native IR model (commit `3da56d0`). The block model is reintroduced
> as the canonical intermediate representation — see
> [07-adr-blocks-canonical-ir.md](07-adr-blocks-canonical-ir.md) for the decision record.

## 1. Entity overview

```
Store 1──* Source 1──* Resource 1──* Block 1──* Chunk
                           │                       │
                      IndexJob            Citation (view over Chunk + Resource)
```

Ingestors produce **Resources** containing ordered **Blocks**. Each block has a `BlockKind`,
canonical text, and optional source-location metadata. The chunker operates on blocks (not a
Markdown string), and `heading_path` is derived from the block tree (heading blocks preceding
content blocks). Chunks never cross block boundaries, with one explicit exception: message-window
chunks span multiple `Message`/`Segment` blocks.

## 2. Entities

### Store

A named knowledge base. Unit of sharing, ACLs, indexing policy, and federation.

| Field        | Notes                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Stable ULID, minted at creation; never reused.                                                                                  |
| `name`       | Human-readable, unique per instance.                                                                                            |
| `visibility` | `private` \| `shared`. MVP: only `private` functional; field exists from day one ([01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) §5). |
| `backend`    | Backend kind + connection info; default `libsql`.                                                                               |
| `indexing`   | Indexing policy: `{chunking, embedding, parsers}` as one unit ([03-config.md](03-config.md) §2).                                |
| `acl`        | Reserved; empty in MVP.                                                                                                         |

### Source

Where a store's content comes from. Each source is driven by an **ingestor** that knows how to
acquire and structure its content.

| Field                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `store_id`           | Owning store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ingestor_kind`      | Which ingestor drives this source: `file`, `url`, and future connectors (`notion`, `telegram`, `signal`, `hackmd`, `email`, `transcription`, `feed`). See [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) §1 for the `IngestorKind` enum. |
| `spec`               | Kind-specific configuration: root path + globs, URL + refresh interval, API token reference, etc. Stored as JSON; validated by the ingestor's `IngestorConfig`.                                                                    |
| `config_json`        | Ingestor-specific configuration fields (typed per ingestor).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `source_kind_preset` | Which indexing preset applies (`prose`, `messages`, `code`) — see [03-config.md](03-config.md) §2.                                                                                                                                 |

**Runtime representation:** `SourceRow` in `core::backend` is the concrete Rust type for sources
persisted in the unified database (`localdb.db`). Source CRUD is exposed via `StoreBackend` methods
(`upsert_source`, `delete_source`, `list_sources`, `get_source`, `find_source_by_root_or_url`).

### Resource

One logical content unit produced by an ingestor. Replaces the former `Document` entity. A resource
is: a file, a fetched page, a Notion page, a conversation thread, a transcript, a feed entry.

| Field                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                        | **Content-addressed**: `blake3(uri ‖ content_hash)` — see §3.                                                                                        |
| `source_id`, `store_id`     | Ownership.                                                                                                                                           |
| `ingestor_kind`             | Which ingestor produced this resource (denormalized from source for queries).                                                                        |
| `resource_kind`             | `document` \| `conversation` \| `transcription`. Determines block ordering semantics.                                                                |
| `uri`                       | `Uri` newtype wrapping `url::Url`. Canonical locator (absolute path as `file://`, URL, or connector-defined scheme like `notion://`, `telegram://`). |
| `external_id`               | Arbitrary source-system ID (Notion page ID, Telegram message ID, email Message-ID). Optional.                                                        |
| `external_etag`             | Change detection token from the source system (HTTP ETag, Notion `last_edited_time`, file mtime). Optional.                                          |
| `content_hash`              | blake3 of ordered block canonical texts concatenated. Drives incremental re-index. Not dependent on Markdown rendering.                              |
| `title`, `mime`, `language` | From extraction. `language` is BCP 47.                                                                                                               |
| `date_original`             | Dublin Core date string (may be partial, e.g. `2026` or `2026-06`).                                                                                  |
| `date_parsed`               | Best-effort ISO 8601 parse of `date_original` (sortable).                                                                                            |
| `added_at`                  | When first indexed (our timestamp, RFC 3339).                                                                                                        |
| `modified_at`               | When content last changed (RFC 3339).                                                                                                                |
| `thread_id`                 | Conversation thread identifier (conversation resources only).                                                                                        |
| `channel`                   | Channel/folder/chat name (conversation resources only).                                                                                              |
| `participants`              | JSON array of participant names/IDs (conversation resources only).                                                                                   |
| `metadata`                  | `Metadata` enum — see §7. Contains Dublin Core base fields plus resource-kind-specific fields.                                                       |
| `provenance`                | See §4.                                                                                                                                              |
| `extractor_version`         | Version string of the parser/ingestor that produced the blocks. Enables reprocessing when extraction logic improves.                                 |

### Block

A typed, ordered unit of content within a resource.

| Field           | Notes                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resource_id`   | Parent resource.                                                                             |
| `seq`           | Ordering within the resource (0-indexed). Stable as long as resource content doesn't change. |
| `kind`          | `BlockKind` — see §2a.                                                                       |
| `text`          | Canonical text content of the block. Every block kind has a text representation.             |
| `metadata_json` | Kind-specific structured metadata (e.g. heading level, sender, timestamp).                   |
| `location`      | `BlockLocation` — optional source-location data for citation/navigation (§2b).               |

**Identity:** blocks are identified by `(resource_id, seq)`, not content-addressed. They are derived
content that can be regenerated by re-running the ingestor.

### Feed connector (`SourceSpec::Feed`)

`ingestor_kind = feed` parses RSS 2.0, Atom 1.0, and JSON Feed via `feed-rs`, with `feed-rs`'s
`sanitize` feature (an `ammonia` pass over embedded entry HTML) always applied.

| Field                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                   | Feed URL.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `max_entries`           | `Option<u32>`. Cap on entries considered per fetch, applied after the sort described below. `0` is rejected at config time, not treated as "index nothing." |
| `fetch_full_content`    | `bool`, default `true`. Selects **discovery mode** (`true`) vs. **single-document mode** (`false`) — see below.                                             |
| `refresh_interval_secs` | `Option<u64>`. Same shape and column (`sources.refresh`) as `SourceSpec::Url`.                                                                              |

`{max_entries, fetch_full_content}` persist as JSON in `sources.config_json` — the column exists at
baseline (v4), so the feed connector needed no schema migration. `refresh_interval_secs` persists in
the pre-existing `sources.refresh` column alongside `url` sources.

**Discovery mode (default).** A feed is treated as a URL-discovery meta-wrapper, not itself the
indexed content: parse the feed, then for each entry resolve the entry's link and run it through the
_same_ per-URL pipeline `UrlIngestor` uses for `url` sources (fetch page → parser chain → blocks →
`Resource`), via a shared `ingest/src/url_pipeline.rs` helper — a feed entry and a
directly-configured `url` source produce identically-shaped Resources. Entry metadata enriches the
resulting Resource: `external_id` = the entry's feed-native ID, `creator` = entry authors — falling
back to the **feed-level** `<author>` when the entry declares none, per Atom's inheritance rule (RFC
4287 §4.2.1); an entry's own authors win outright and the two lists are never merged — the metadata
date = the entry's published/updated timestamp, `metadata.source` = the feed URL (provenance back to
the discovering feed), `external_etag` captured from the entry-link fetch. The Resource's `uri` (and
therefore its content-addressed `id`, §3) keys off the entry's **pre-redirect, feed-declared link**,
not wherever it 30x's to, so re-fetching the same feed resolves to the same Resource identity
regardless of redirect-target churn. That is a statement about _identity_, distinct from _link
resolution_: a relative entry link (e.g. `<link>article.html</link>`) is resolved by `feed-rs`
against the feed's **effective (post-redirect) URL**, not the configured `feed_url` — a feed that
301's to a new host must still resolve its entries' relative links against that new host, not the
stale one it was configured with. `xml:base`, where present in the feed XML, still takes precedence
over that base URI (feed-rs's own resolution rule). Once resolved, the link is the feed-declared
link that identity keys off, per the paragraph above — resolution decides _where a relative link
points_; identity decides _what URI names the Resource_, and stays pinned to that resolved link
regardless of where the linked page itself later redirects. Entries with no link get a fragment URI
instead: `{feed_url}#entry:{entry.id}`.

**General connector pattern.** Discovery mode plus the fragment-URI fallback is not feed-specific —
it's the expected shape for any ingestor that discovers sub-resource URIs from a parent resource:
enrich the discovered Resource from the parent's metadata, key its identity off the discovered URI,
and fall back to `{parent_uri}#fragment:{id}` when no addressable URI exists. Two connectors on the
roadmap ([06-roadmap.md](06-roadmap.md)) are expected to follow it: email (#114, discovering
message/attachment URIs from a mailbox) and conversation exports (#129, discovering per-message
permalinks from a thread).

**Single-document mode** (`fetch_full_content: false`): the whole feed becomes **one** Resource,
`uri` = the feed URL itself, assembled deterministically rather than fetched:

```
# {feed.title | "Untitled Feed"}

{feed.description, if present}

## {entry.title | "Untitled Entry"}

*By {authors} — {date RFC3339} — {link}*

{entry body: content, else summary, else nothing}

## {next entry.title | "Untitled Entry"}
...
```

The byline line omits missing parts outright — no placeholder text, and the entry's guid never
appears in it. `{authors}` follows the same feed-level inheritance rule discovery mode uses: an
entry with no `<author>` of its own bylines the feed's.

**Destination policy (entry links).** Entry links are the only locators in localdb chosen by a third
party rather than by the operator, so discovery mode fetches them through a
**public-destination-only** HTTP client. Any request — or any redirect hop — whose host is, or
resolves to, a non-globally-routable address (loopback, RFC 1918 private, link-local incl.
`169.254.169.254`, CGNAT, ULA, multicast, reserved, and their IPv4-mapped-IPv6 forms) is refused
before a connection is opened, and the entry falls back to its embedded content exactly like
`Gone`/`Unsupported`/`Empty` below. Filtering happens inside a custom DNS resolver, so the address
reqwest connects to is the address that was checked (no rebinding window). **The feed URL itself and
`url` sources are unaffected** — both are operator-configured, and a homelab or LAN address is a
legitimate thing for an operator to point localdb at. Guarding entry links only also means an
internal feed degrades gracefully rather than failing at step one: its entries are still indexed,
from their embedded summaries. There is no opt-out in v0.1; the per-source/global allowance for
private destinations is tracked as a known gap in
[../docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md#known-gaps).

**Both modes:** entries are stable-sorted by `published.or(updated)` descending (entries with
neither date sort last, stable among themselves), then **deduplicated by resolved resource URI** —
the same URI that becomes the Resource's identity (the entry's resolved link, or the
`{feed_url}#entry:{entry.id}` fragment for a link-less entry) — keeping the first (i.e. newest)
survivor and dropping the rest, then truncated to `max_entries`. `max_entries` therefore counts
_distinct_ resource URIs, not raw entry count: two entries that resolve to the same URI cost one
slot, not two. First-wins (not last-wins) is deliberate: when a feed lists the same URI more than
once, the newest listing is the feed's most current claim about that URI, so it is the one that
should win whichever content ends up indexed for it.

**Timestamps.** Feed-produced Resources map times as follows. `added_at` is always ingestion-time
`now()` — it records when _our store_ first saw the resource, never a feed-claimed date.
`modified_at` comes from the feed when it says anything: per entry `updated.or(published)`
(discovery mode and the embedded fallback), and in single-document mode `feed.updated`, else the
newest entry's date, else `now()`. Creation/publication stays in `dublin_core.date` =
`published.or(updated)` (the conventional DC slot) — note the opposite preference order from
`modified_at`, matching each field's semantics. Like all enrichment, an already-indexed entry whose
content hash is unchanged does not retroactively pick these up (the pipeline's incremental-skip runs
before any store write).

**Fallback and error handling:**

- Discovery mode, entry-link fetch returns `Gone`/`Unsupported`/`Blocked`: falls back to indexing
  the entry's own embedded content/summary at the same URI, instead of dropping the entry. All three
  are _stable_ properties of the link (a 404 stays a 404; a refused destination is refused
  identically next run), which is what makes falling back safe — contrast the transient cases below.
- Discovery mode, entry-link fetch returns a transient `FetchError`/`ParseFailed`: no fallback —
  reported as a per-item error and skipped this run. Falling back here would flip the Resource's
  content hash between "full page" and "feed summary" on every transient outage, forcing needless
  re-embedding; the existing good index is left alone instead.
- A fetched entry page — or, having fallen back that far, the entry's own embedded content — that
  extracts to empty or whitespace-only Markdown is **unusable, not empty**: it falls through the
  same `content → summary → title` chain that `Gone`/`Unsupported` use, and never yields a
  zero-block Resource. A zero-block Resource reaching `index_resource` is refused by the sink and
  reported as a skip — it can no longer delete the previously indexed document (see
  [04-search-pipeline.md](04-search-pipeline.md) §1) — but the fallback chain's rationale is
  unchanged: an entry whose page yields nothing should still be indexed from its summary or title
  rather than left to the sink's refusal, which preserves the _old_ content rather than producing
  the best content available now. The embedded-content chain's own empty-Markdown guards
  (`feed_ingestor.rs`'s `entry_routed_content`) exist for that reason, extended here to the
  fetched-page path that shares the same fallthrough logic.
- An invalid feed URL in config fails the whole source run fast (`invalid_config`). Everything else
  data-driven — malformed feed XML, malformed entries, entry-link fetch failures — is per-item
  `on_skipped(Error)` + continue. An empty feed (zero entries) is valid, not an error.
- Feed autodiscovery from HTML pages (`<link rel="alternate">`) is out of scope.

**Retention:** feed sources are exempt from the pipeline's delete-sweep — a feed exposes only its
most recent entries, so an entry falling out of the feed does not mean it was deleted upstream, and
a feed `304`/transient-empty-parse would otherwise wipe an entire source's index in one sweep.
`source remove` still cascades normally. See
[docs/architecture.md#known-gaps](../docs/architecture.md#known-gaps) for the resulting archive
semantics and the pruning follow-up.

**Ordering semantics** depend on `ResourceKind`:

- `document` — logical reading order
- `conversation` — chronological message order
- `transcription` — transcript time order

### §2a. BlockKind

| Kind          | Text content               | Metadata fields                                                                                         | Typical sources                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Heading`     | Heading text               | `level: u8` (1–6)                                                                                       | Documents, Notion pages               |
| `Text`        | Running body text (coarse) | —                                                                                                       | Documents, HTML, Notion               |
| `Code`        | Code content               | `language: Option<String>`                                                                              | Markdown fences, Notion code blocks   |
| `Table`       | Text rendering of table    | `headers: Vec<String>`, `rows: usize`                                                                   | Documents, spreadsheets               |
| `Message`     | Message body text          | `sender: String`, `timestamp: Option<String>`, `message_id: Option<String>`, `reply_to: Option<String>` | Conversations (chat, email)           |
| `Segment`     | Transcript segment text    | `speaker: Option<String>`, `start_ms: u64`, `end_ms: u64`                                               | Transcriptions (SRT, VTT, Whisper)    |
| `Reference`   | `"[label](target)"`        | `target: String`, `label: Option<String>`, `ref_type: Option<String>`                                   | Wikilinks, Notion mentions, citations |
| `Attachment`  | `"filename: description"`  | `filename: String`, `mime: Option<String>`, `size_bytes: Option<u64>`                                   | Email attachments, Notion files       |
| `Frontmatter` | Raw frontmatter text       | `format: String` (yaml/toml/json)                                                                       | Markdown, Obsidian                    |
| `Image`       | Alt text or OCR text       | `alt: Option<String>`, `src: Option<String>`                                                            | Documents with images                 |

**Coarse `Text` kind:** `Text` is the single running-body-text kind; it folds the former
`Paragraph`/`Quote`/`List` variants. `markdown_to_blocks` emits one `Text` block per run of
consecutive running-text content (paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, HTML) between structural
boundaries (`Heading`/`Table`/`Code`/`Image`/document start-end). Rationale and chunker
consequences: [04-search-pipeline.md](04-search-pipeline.md) §3 and
[07-adr-blocks-canonical-ir.md](07-adr-blocks-canonical-ir.md) ("Ontology axes: kind ⊥ role ⊥
group").

### §2b. BlockLocation

Source-location metadata for citation and navigation. Not all fields apply to every block kind.

| Field                    | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `page`                   | Page number (1-indexed, for PDFs and paginated documents).         |
| `bbox`                   | Bounding box `{x, y, width, height}` (for PDFs with layout).       |
| `section`                | Section identifier or path (e.g. `["Chapter 1", "Introduction"]`). |
| `line_start`, `line_end` | Line range in source file (for code and plain text).               |
| `uri_fragment`           | URI fragment (e.g. `#heading-id` for HTML).                        |

### Chunk

The retrieval unit: what gets embedded and indexed.

| Field                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                      | **Content-addressed**: `blake3(resource_id ‖ block_seq ‖ chunk_text ‖ seq_in_block)` — stable across re-runs over identical content. Computed _after_ `block_seq`/`seq_in_block` are assigned, so both are inputs to the hash, not derived from it.                                            |
| `resource_id`, `store_id` | Ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `block_seq`               | Sequence number of the parent block (denormalized, for efficient ordering without a join).                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `seq_in_block`            | Chunk position within the block (0-indexed).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `text`                    | Chunk text (also feeds BM25).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `heading_path`            | Derived from the block tree: heading blocks preceding this content block. JSON array.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `embedding`               | Dense vector (in backend, not in core serialization).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `location`                | `ChunkLocation` — refined sub-block position (optional). Persisted as `location_json`: `{"start": N, "end": N, "window_block_seqs": [..]}`, with `window_block_seqs` absent/optional for non-window chunks. `ChunkRecord` carries this as `window_block_seqs: Vec<u32>` (`#[serde(default)]`). |

**Invariant:** a chunk is a subdivision of exactly one block. The canonical block reference is the
triple **`(store_id, resource_id, block_seq)`** — there is no `block_id` column; blocks are looked
up by sequence number, not by a synthetic row reference. The chunks index is
`(store_id, resource_id, block_seq, seq_in_block)`. Chunks never cross block boundaries.

**Why not `block_id`:** an earlier revision of this schema referenced the parent block via
`chunks.block_id` (a `blocks.rowid` foreign key). That column is dropped (#128): rowids are not
stable across a replace (delete+insert of a resource mints new block rows), and window chunks (#129)
need to reference a _set_ of block sequence numbers, which a single scalar foreign key cannot
express. `(store_id, resource_id, block_seq)` is stable and generalizes to sets.

**Span semantics:** Chunk spans (`location.start`, `location.end`) are **block-relative byte
offsets** — they index into the parent block's `text`, not the full document Markdown. Combined with
`block_seq`, they provide a complete location: `(resource_id, block_seq, span)`. Document-relative
offsets are not stored or computed.

For prose and code chunks (`Text`/`Code`-block content), a span locates its chunk's exact text:
`block.text[span.start..span.end] == chunk.text`. **Adjacent spans within a block are not guaranteed
contiguous** — the underlying splitter trims whitespace from chunk boundaries, so a small gap
between one chunk's `end` and the next chunk's `start` is normal, not a bug. Any such gap contains
only whitespace. Spans are therefore **not a partition of the block**: consumers MUST NOT
reconstruct block text by concatenating chunk spans or chunk texts in sequence — use `block.text`
directly if the full block is needed.

Two chunk shapes are exempt from the exact-slice equality; consumers MUST NOT slice `block.text` by
span expecting it to equal `chunk.text` for them:

- **Reconstructed table chunks:** a table chunk's text is normally _reconstructed_ Markdown — the
  header row is re-emitted in every chunk — so no substring of the block corresponds to it. These
  chunks carry the placeholder span `(0, 0)`; their span is not meaningful. Table blocks that fall
  back to the code chunker (a malformed table with no recognizable header/separator row, or a single
  row too large to fit a chunk) emit chunks with real spans that DO satisfy the exact-slice
  contract. Rule of thumb for `block_kind == "table"`: a `(0, 0)` span is a placeholder; a
  non-degenerate span slices exactly.
- **Message chunks:** all `messages`-preset chunk text is prefixed with sender/timestamp metadata
  that is not part of any block's `text`. Sliding-window chunks additionally span multiple
  `Message`/`Segment` blocks — an explicit multi-block chunking mode — and carry the placeholder
  span `(0, 0)`. The `ChunkLocation` carries `window_block_seqs`, the set of participating block
  sequence numbers (`window_block_seqs` is non-empty for every `messages`-preset chunk, including
  the single-oversized-turn split case where it has exactly one element; it is empty for prose,
  code, and table chunks). For an oversized-turn split chunk, the span _is_ meaningful but locates
  the chunk's text within the raw turn text, minus the prepended prefix: `block.text[span]` equals
  `chunk.text` with the sender prefix stripped.

### Citation

Not a stored entity: the **canonical result shape** every surface uses (§6).

### IndexJob

A unit of indexing work with observable state. Fields: `id` (ULID), `store_id`, `scope` (full store
/ one source / one resource — the one-resource variant, `IndexJobScope::Document`, is accepted by
the type but currently unreachable: nothing constructs it, since `POST /v1/jobs` has no
`resource_id` field), `state` (`pending` → `running` → `done` | `failed`), `stats`, `error`,
timestamps. `stats` (`IndexJobStats`) carries `docs_seen`, `docs_indexed`, `docs_skipped` (unchanged
content hash), `docs_deleted`, `docs_prunable` (would-have-been-deleted count under
`DeletionPolicy::Retain`), `chunks_written`, `unsupported_format_count`, `error_count`, and
`sources_count` (size of the job's resolved scope before processing, distinguishing "nothing to
index" from "sources existed but nothing needed indexing"). Both embedded and daemon-submitted jobs
run through the same async engine (`server::job_exec::run_job`, driven by a `JobQueue`) — the CLI's
embedded mode spins up its own in-process, single-job `JobQueue` per invocation rather than running
synchronously outside the job model; the daemon's `JobQueue` is long-lived and serves every job for
the process's lifetime, one at a time per store (a per-store in-flight guard rejects a second
concurrent submission with `index_in_progress`) ([05-surfaces.md](05-surfaces.md) §3).

## 3. ID scheme

**Decision:** entities that exist by fiat (Store, Source, IndexJob) get **ULIDs**; entities derived
from content (Resource, Chunk) get **content-addressed blake3 IDs** as defined above.

**Rationale:** content-addressed IDs are the federation prerequisite — two nodes indexing the same
content derive the same chunk identity, enabling dedup, provenance comparison, and integrity checks
without coordination ([VISION.md](../VISION.md)). They also make re-indexing idempotent.
**Rejected:** auto-increment rows (meaningless off-node); UUIDv4 for resources/chunks (stable only
by table lookup, not by content).

Consequence: a resource edit produces a _new_ resource ID; the pipeline treats it as replace-by-URI
(delete chunks of the old ID, insert new) — see [04-search-pipeline.md](04-search-pipeline.md) §2.

**Block identity:** blocks are identified by `(resource_id, seq)`, not content-addressed. They are
derived content — stable as long as the resource content and extractor version don't change. When
the resource is re-ingested, blocks are replaced entirely.

## 4. Provenance

Every resource and every chunk carries:

| Field          | Notes                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `origin_store` | Store ID where it was first indexed (≠ current store after future federation). |
| `source_ref`   | Source ID + ingestor kind.                                                     |
| `fetched_at`   | Acquisition time (file mtime at scan / HTTP fetch time).                       |
| `content_hash` | blake3 of resource content (ordered block texts concatenated).                 |
| `share_path`   | Reserved, empty in MVP: list of (node, store) hops for federated content.      |

**Write path.** A chunk's `fetched_at` is always taken from its resource's `added_at`, never its
`modified_at` — it is persisted as `resources.added_at`, and that is the column
`MetadataFilter::FetchedAfter`/`FetchedBefore` filter on and every citation's
`provenance.fetched_at` reports.

## 5. Conversations and non-document resources

The resource model natively supports non-document content shapes:

- **Conversations** (chat, email): `resource_kind = conversation`. Each message is a `Message` block
  with sender, timestamp, and message ID. Thread identity via `thread_id` on the resource. Chunked
  by the `messages` preset (sliding turn windows).
- **Transcriptions** (SRT, VTT, Whisper JSON): `resource_kind = transcription`. Each segment is a
  `Segment` block with speaker, start/end timestamps. Chunked by time windows respecting speaker
  boundaries.
- **Documents** (files, web pages, Notion pages): `resource_kind = document`. Blocks follow logical
  reading order. Chunked by the `prose` or `code` presets dispatched per block kind.

Metadata is resource-kind-specific via the `Metadata` enum (§7), not open key-value `meta` keys.

## 6. Citation model

Every search hit, on every surface, resolves to the same citation structure:

```json
{
  "resource_id": "...",
  "uri": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "block": { "seq": 3, "kind": "text", "page": 12 },
  "chunk_position": { "seq_in_block": 0 },
  "location": {
    "span": { "start": 120, "end": 512 },
    "window_block_seqs": [3, 4, 5]
  }
}
```

That's the shape of the field list distinctive to the block model; the full `Citation` also carries
`chunk_id`, `store: {id, name}`, `heading_path`, `snippet` (chunk text, possibly trimmed), the full
`score: {fused, dense, bm25}` breakdown, `provenance: {fetched_at, content_hash}`, and `metadata`
(the tagged `Metadata` enum — Dublin Core base + resource-kind-specific fields, §7). There is no
top-level `document_id`, `block_seq`, `block_kind`, or `span` — those are superseded by
`resource_id`, the nested `block {seq, kind, page}`, `chunk_position {seq_in_block}`, and
`location {span, window_block_seqs}` respectively. `window_block_seqs` is present only for
message-window chunks (§2); absent otherwise.

`block.page` is the 1-indexed page number for paginated source formats (today: PDF), copied from the
originating block's `location.page` (§2b); absent for non-paginated formats and for chunks indexed
before page plumbing existed. **Page attribution rule:** a block's page is the page containing its
_first contributing byte_ in the extracted Markdown. Blocks are never split at page boundaries — a
paragraph or coarse `Text` run that crosses a page break carries the page it starts on. (Splitting
would fight the coarse-`Text` run packing (#158), which packs chunks within blocks.)

Surface mappings — defined here once, referenced by [05-surfaces.md](05-surfaces.md): **HTTP**
returns the structure verbatim as JSON. **CLI** renders `uri` + heading path + snippet (and full
JSON with `--json`). **MCP** returns it as structured tool output content, never as prose-only text,
so agents can cite mechanically.

**Context expansion:** given a search hit, the backend supports:

1. Neighboring chunks in the same block
   (`chunks WHERE store_id = ? AND resource_id = ? AND block_seq = ? ORDER BY seq_in_block`)
2. Nearby blocks in the same resource (`blocks WHERE resource_id = ? AND seq BETWEEN ? AND ?`)
3. Full resource block sequence (`blocks WHERE resource_id = ? ORDER BY seq`)

## 7. Metadata taxonomy

### DublinCoreMetadata (base for all resource kinds)

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set 1.1 (DCMES), all 15 elements. Repeatable elements (multi-valued)
use `Vec<String>`; singleton elements use `Option<String>`.

| Element       | Type             | Notes                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | `Option<String>` | Title of the resource.                                  |
| `creator`     | `Vec<String>`    | Repeatable: authors, creators.                          |
| `subject`     | `Vec<String>`    | Repeatable: topics, keywords.                           |
| `description` | `Option<String>` | Summary or abstract.                                    |
| `publisher`   | `Option<String>` | Entity responsible for making the resource available.   |
| `contributor` | `Vec<String>`    | Repeatable: additional contributors.                    |
| `date`        | `Option<String>` | Date of creation or publication (ISO 8601 recommended). |
| `r#type`      | `Option<String>` | Nature or genre of the resource.                        |
| `format`      | `Option<String>` | File format or media type.                              |
| `identifier`  | `Option<String>` | Unambiguous reference (URL, DOI, ISBN, …).              |
| `source`      | `Option<String>` | Source resource this document is derived from.          |
| `language`    | `Option<String>` | Language of the resource (BCP 47 recommended).          |
| `relation`    | `Vec<String>`    | Repeatable: related resources.                          |
| `coverage`    | `Option<String>` | Spatial or temporal extent.                             |

#### Population by source format

EPUB populates the set from the OPF, whose metadata _is_ Dublin Core. PDF populates it from the Info
dictionary first, with XMP as a per-field fallback: `/Title`, `/Author` → `creator`, `/Subject` →
`description`, `/Keywords` → `subject` (split on `,` and `;`), `/CreationDate` → `date` (PDF date
syntax `D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm'` parsed to ISO-8601; on parse failure the field is left empty rather
than storing the raw string), then XMP's `dc:creator`, `dc:description`, `dc:subject`,
`dc:language`, `dc:rights` and `xmp:CreateDate`.

Two fields are deliberately left empty for PDFs. `publisher` has no honest source — the Info
dictionary's nearest key, `/Producer`, is the _generating software_ ("Adobe PDF Library 15.0"), not
the publisher of the work. And `title` has no filename or first-page fallback: a PDF that carries
neither `/Title` nor XMP has no title, and inventing one would be a guess presented as data.

`format` is set by the parser from the sniffed MIME type, not read from the document.

### Metadata enum

```rust
enum Metadata {
    Document(DocumentMetadata),       // DC base + document-specific fields
    Conversation(ConversationMetadata), // DC base + conversation-specific fields
    Transcription(TranscriptionMetadata), // DC base + transcription-specific fields
}
```

Each variant embeds `DublinCoreMetadata` and adds kind-specific fields:

- **DocumentMetadata**: `page_count: Option<u32>`, `word_count: Option<u32>`.
- **ConversationMetadata**: `platform: Option<String>`, `message_count: Option<u32>`,
  `date_range: Option<(String, String)>`.
- **TranscriptionMetadata**: `duration_ms: Option<u64>`, `speakers: Vec<String>`,
  `media_uri: Option<String>`.

All variants expose `fn dublin_core(&self) -> &DublinCoreMetadata` for uniform access to the base
metadata fields.

**Persistence:** `Metadata` is JSON-encoded into a single `TEXT` column named `metadata_json` on
each resource record in libsql. The discriminant is the `Metadata` enum variant tag (e.g.
`{"kind":"document","dublin_core":{...},"page_count":...}`).

**Metadata unification (#130):** the flat, parser-level `DocumentMetadata` struct (a bare 15-element
Dublin Core struct that lived in the parser boundary and was easily confused with the same-named
`DocumentMetadata` variant payload above) is retired. `ParsedDocument.metadata` is
`DublinCoreMetadata` directly — the same base type every `Metadata` variant embeds — so there is
exactly one Dublin-Core-shaped struct in the codebase, not two. Resources, chunks, and citations all
carry the tagged `Metadata` enum; nothing downstream of parsing sees the untagged flat form.

**Reads (`document get`/`document list`, specs/05-surfaces.md §2, §3, §4):** CLI, HTTP, and MCP each
surface a document's registry row plus this tagged `Metadata` verbatim. Because the write path
already stored the enum in its tagged shape from the start, adding these read surfaces needed no
rewrite of stored data — they are exactly the Resource-based reads this section's shape was already
built to answer.

## 8. Extraction & parsing

### Ingestor trait (acquisition + structuring)

The `Ingestor` trait (`core/src/ingestor.rs`) is the abstraction for content acquisition and
structuring. Each ingestor knows how to connect to a source, enumerate content, and produce
`Resource`s with typed blocks.

| Method   | Signature                                                                | Notes                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `kind`   | `(&self) -> IngestorKind`                                                | Which ingestor kind this is.     |
| `ingest` | `(&self, source, config) -> impl Stream<Item = Result<Resource, Error>>` | Async stream yielding resources. |

**IngestorKind** enum: `File`, `Url`, `Notion`, `Telegram`, `Signal`, `HackMd`, `Email`,
`Transcription`, `Feed`. The enum lives in `core`; concrete ingestor implementations live outside
`core` (in `cli`, dedicated crates, or a future `ingest` crate).

**Crate boundary:** `core::Ingestor` is the contract (yields `Resource`s). Terminal interaction,
credential prompts, HTTP/API clients, and source-specific setup live outside `core`, consistent with
the "no I/O frameworks in core" invariant ([01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) §1).

### Parser chain (file-ingestor implementation detail)

The `Parser` trait remains as the abstraction for format-specific text extraction within the **file
ingestor**. Parsers now return `Resource` (with typed blocks) instead of `ParsedDocument`. The
`markdown_to_blocks()` helper converts Markdown pulldown-cmark events to typed blocks, so existing
parsers can emit Markdown as before and convert at the boundary.

Each `Parser` is `Send + Sync` and runs synchronously (CPU-bound); callers run it under
`spawn_blocking`. Two methods:

| Method  | Signature                                                  | Notes                                                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`    | `(&self) -> &'static str`                                  | Stable string used in the `parsers:` config list and diagnostics. |
| `parse` | `(&self, &Probe) -> Result<Option<ParsedDocument>, Error>` | See contract below.                                               |

**Contract — three outcomes:**

- `Ok(None)` — decline; this parser does not handle the input. Control passes to the next parser in
  the chain.
- `Ok(Some(doc))` — handled successfully. First match wins; remaining parsers are not tried.
- `Err(e)` — the format was recognized but parsing failed. **Short-circuits the chain** — remaining
  parsers are NOT tried, because the failure is definitive, not a format mismatch.

`ChainParser` implements this same `Parser` trait (Composite pattern), holding an ordered
`Vec<Box<dyn Parser>>`. It is itself a `Parser` and can be nested. `build_chain(ids)` in
`extract/src/registry.rs` maps the config `parsers:` strings to concrete `Parser` instances.

### Probe

`Probe` is the fully-buffered input presented to each parser. The streaming or HTTPS read happens
once at the ingestion boundary; parsers never seek or re-fetch.

| Field / method               | Notes                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bytes`                      | Full document bytes.                                                                    |
| `path_hint: Option<&str>`    | Original filename or URL path — used for file-extension hints. Advisory; may be absent. |
| `sniffed_mime: Option<&str>` | MIME type inferred before parsing. Advisory; may be wrong or `None`.                    |
| `header()`                   | Up to `PROBE_HEADER_LEN` (8 192) leading bytes for cheap magic-byte sniffing.           |

### ParsedDocument → Resource conversion

`ParsedDocument` remains as the parser output: a Markdown string + title + `DublinCoreMetadata`. The
file ingestor converts it to a `Resource` by:

1. Running `markdown_to_blocks()` on the Markdown string to produce typed blocks.
2. Wrapping `ParsedDocument.metadata` (`DublinCoreMetadata`) into
   `Metadata::Document(DocumentMetadata { dublin_core, page_count, word_count })` — see §7.
3. Computing the content hash from ordered block texts.

This conversion is a compatibility bridge. Future parsers and ingestors can emit blocks directly.

## 9. Storage schema design rationale

The unified database schema uses several design patterns to ensure referential integrity and query
performance:

- **Composite Uniqueness:** The `resources` and `chunks` tables use composite `(store_id, id)`
  uniqueness. Content-addressed IDs can collide across stores by design. Each store maintains its
  own rows. Cross-store deduplication is deferred to query-time `GROUP BY` operations.
- **Normalized Blocks:** The `blocks` table stores individual blocks as rows (not a JSON blob),
  enabling efficient context expansion queries (fetch neighboring blocks for a search hit).
- **Denormalised Store ID:** The `store_id` column is denormalised onto the `chunks` table for
  per-store filtering directly on the rowid lookup after vector or FTS5 searches.
- **Block Reference on Chunks:** Each chunk references its parent block via denormalized `block_seq`
  (no `block_id`/rowid foreign key — see §2), enabling block-level context expansion without an
  extra join, on the composite index
  `idx_chunks_store_resource_pos (store_id, resource_id, block_seq, seq_in_block)`.
- **FTS5 Content Keying:** The FTS5 virtual table `chunks_fts` uses external content keying over
  `chunks.text`. Filtering by `store_id` is performed on the `chunks` join.
- **Cascade Chain:** Foreign keys with `ON DELETE CASCADE` across the chain:
  `stores → sources → resources → blocks → chunks`. Deleting a store cleans up everything.
- **Schema Versioning:** A `schema_migrations` table is the **source of truth** for schema version;
  `PRAGMA user_version` is kept in lockstep as a cheap head marker but is never authoritative.

  | `checksum`                | `blake3` over the migration's version, name, rendered up-SQL, and rendered down-SQL (or reason). Verified on every open, bounded to the already-applied prefix before `db migrate` applies anything new, and again over the full chain afterward; a mismatch is an `internal` error, not a silent continue. Verification also requires a row to _exist_ for the baseline and every applicable chain version (not just checking whatever rows happen to be present), and that each row's stored `name`/`down_sql`/`down_unsupported_reason` still match the compiled migration even when its `checksum` column reads correctly — a missing or tampered-but-checksum-intact row is treated the same as a checksum mismatch. `db downgrade` similarly requires the row history between its target and the current version to be contiguous before replaying anything. |

  `CHECK` constraint: exactly one of `down_sql` / `down_unsupported_reason` is set per row.

  **Open never migrates**, in either direction, on any surface. A version mismatch on open is a
  refusal (`invalid_config`, exit 2) with an actionable hint, not an automatic fix:
  - Legacy `0 < version < 4` (v1–v3): refused; hint points at `localdb db migrate` (which rebuilds
    destructively, behind a confirmation prompt) or deleting the database. Previously these versions
    triggered silent reinitialization on open; nothing is silent now.
  - `4 <= version < head` (pending migrations): refused; hint points at `localdb db migrate`.
  - `version > head` (store newer than this binary): refused; hint points at `localdb db downgrade`
    or upgrading localdb.

  Migrations are applied only via the explicit `localdb db migrate` /
  `localdb db downgrade [--to N]` CLI commands ([05-surfaces.md](05-surfaces.md) §2) — never by the
  HTTP daemon or MCP, which only ever surface the refusal-with-hint.

  **Downgradable by older binaries:** every migration's rendered down-SQL is stored _as data_ in
  `schema_migrations.down_sql`, so an older binary can replay it without knowing the newer schema.
  Migrations that are irreversible or expressed as Rust functions instead record
  `down_unsupported_reason`; `db downgrade` past such a step is refused cleanly, naming the
  migration and the reason, without touching the store. Freshly created stores are seeded with a
  `schema_migrations` row (including down-SQL) for every chain migration, so a brand-new store on
  the latest binary is downgradable too.

  **Three weight classes**, by authoring cost and what's allowed to run inside `db migrate`:
  1. **Fast schema DDL** — ordinary transactional runner steps.
  2. **In-DB rebuilds** (FTS5 rebuild, DiskANN index drop + recreate) — single-statement runner
     steps that may take minutes; acceptable because `db migrate` is explicit and reports per-step
     progress.
  3. **Re-embedding / re-extraction** — not runnable by the store itself, since it needs the
     embedder/extractors that live above `store-libsql`. The migration only _marks_ the work (bumps
     the required `policy_version`/`extractor_version`, truncates derived rows); the existing
     staleness machinery and incremental `localdb index` do the actual work, resumably and with
     progress. `db migrate` ends with a `localdb index` hint whenever it applied a migration of this
     class.

  **Write-twice rule:** `create_schema()` always represents _head_ DDL directly (not by replaying
  the chain) — every migration is written twice, once as a chain entry and once folded into
  `create_schema()`. A CI drift-guard test asserts baseline schema + chain output is identical to
  `create_schema()`'s output, so the two can't silently diverge.

- **Extractor Versioning:** `resources.extractor_version` tracks which parser/ingestor version
  produced the blocks, enabling selective reprocessing when extraction logic improves.

### Schema v5 (2026-07)

Schema version 5 — the first entry in the migration chain above (§9's `schema_migrations` table),
`drop_chunks_block_id_and_retag_resource_metadata` — ships this refactor's storage changes:

- `chunks.block_id` is dropped (§2, #128); the parent block is looked up by `block_seq`, not a row
  reference.
- New composite index
  `idx_chunks_store_resource_pos (store_id, resource_id, block_seq, seq_in_block)` replaces the old
  `block_id`-keyed lookup.
- `resources.metadata_json` carries the tagged `Metadata` enum encoding (§7), not the retired flat
  `DocumentMetadata`.
- `chunks.location_json` gains the optional `window_block_seqs` array (§2, #129).

**A v4 store refuses to open until migrated:** as with every schema change under the migration
framework, opening a store still at v4 fails with `invalid_config` (exit 2) pointing at
`localdb db migrate` — nothing is wiped implicitly. Running `localdb db migrate` applies this
migration (drops `chunks.block_id`, swaps the index, retags `resources.metadata_json`) in one
transaction and lands the store at v5.

**This migration is not downgradable:** `chunks.block_id` cannot be reconstructed from what remains
once dropped, so its `Down` is `Unsupported` — `localdb db downgrade` refuses cleanly past this
step, naming the reason. It also sets `needs_reindex: true`: applying it marks existing chunks stale
(see the chunk-ID paragraph below), and `db migrate` prints a `localdb index` hint after applying
it.

**Old chunk IDs are tolerated, not migrated:** chunk IDs computed under the pre-#128 formula (keyed
off `block_id`) are not translated to the new
`blake3(resource_id ‖ block_seq ‖ chunk_text ‖ seq_in_block)` formula. Instead, the chunking policy
identifier bumps (`textsplitter-md-v3` → `textsplitter-md-v4`), which changes every chunk's
`policy_version`. The existing incremental-skip check already treats a `policy_version` mismatch as
"needs reindex," so the next `localdb index` re-chunks and re-derives every chunk ID under the new
formula without any special-cased migration logic.
