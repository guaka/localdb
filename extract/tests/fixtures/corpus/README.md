# Difficult-PDF corpus

A small corpus of deliberately-hard, freely-licensed PDFs used by
`extract/tests/corpus.rs` to validate the `pdf_oxide` text-extraction path
against real-world failure classes (issues #87, #45, #65, #157).

Ground truth was produced by having an agent **read the rendered page images**
(pypdfium2 at ~144 DPI) — independent of any text extractor — and transcribe
exact body-text phrases per page. Each PDF has a sibling `<stem>.json`
expectation file the test consumes; `manifest.json` records provenance,
license, sha256, page count, and why each file is difficult.

## What the test checks

For every expectation file whose PDF is present:

- **No panic** — extraction of a malformed PDF must never panic (the #87 class).
- **`expect`** — `"ok"` requires successful extraction, `"err"` requires an
  error, `"any"` accepts either (used for encrypted / heavily-damaged inputs
  where a clean refusal is also correct).
- **`forbid_substrings`** — must never appear in the output (always includes the
  Unicode replacement char `U+FFFD`; the anti-mojibake guarantee, #45/#157).
- **`page_phrases`** — for small, clean `"ok"` documents (≤ 12 pages), a high
  fraction of the transcribed phrases must appear in the extracted text.
  Large books and reading-order-complex layouts are exempt from phrase recall
  (extraction reading order legitimately differs from visual order) but still
  get the no-panic, page-count, and anti-mojibake checks.

## Redistribution

All files except `sewtha-sustainable-energy.pdf` are redistributable under the
licenses listed below and are committed here. `sewtha.pdf` is free to download
but carries no redistribution grant, so it is **not vendored** — fetch it with
`scripts/fetch_test_pdfs.sh` (it lands in this directory, gitignored). The
corpus test is ignored-if-absent, so a missing `sewtha.pdf` simply skips that
one case.
