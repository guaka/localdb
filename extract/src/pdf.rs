//! PDF extraction via `pdf_oxide`: per-page Markdown plus page-start offsets.
//!
//! Each page is converted to Markdown independently and concatenated;
//! `PdfExtract::page_starts` records the byte offset where each page's content
//! begins, which downstream block building resolves into per-block page
//! numbers (#103).
//!
//! Scanned PDFs (no text layer) yield [`Error::UnsupportedFormat`], not
//! garbage text. No pdf_oxide type leaks out of this module — the rest of the
//! crate sees only [`PdfExtract`], keeping a parser swap a one-file change.

/// A block is demoted only when it is BOTH free of code signals AND clearly
/// dominated by prose signals — a conjunction, not a comparison. Any
/// ambiguity (an info string, an unclosed fence, an indented fence, a single
/// code signal anywhere) leaves the block untouched.
///
/// Two structural safety margins:
/// 1. Only **bare** fences are considered. `fence_monospace_blocks` emits no
///    info string, so a ```` ```rust ```` fence is by construction never ours.
/// 2. Any single code signal blocks demotion outright, however much prose
///    surrounds it.

/// Adversarial review found genuine code that reads as prose and is therefore
/// un-fenced: **Inform 7** (a programming language deliberately written as
/// English), period-terminated **Gherkin/BDD** steps, English **pseudocode**
/// paragraphs, and GNU `--help` epilogue prose. These are accepted rather than
/// fixed. The only signal that separates them from novel dialogue is the
/// double quote, and adding `"` to [`CODE_SYMBOLS`] would re-break the
/// dialogue case this guard exists for — precisely backwards. The cost here is
/// a wrong `block_kind` on a rare block, not lost or altered text: the content
