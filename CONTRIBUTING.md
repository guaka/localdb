# Contributing to localdb

**License:** AGPL-3.0-or-later. By submitting a contribution you agree your work is licensed under
the same terms.

**Design authority:** the `specs/` directory. User-facing behavior is described in `docs/`. If they
disagree, `specs/` wins — open an issue to fix the docs, not the spec (unless the spec is wrong).

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain:** install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). The project pins its MSRV in
  `Cargo.toml`; `rustup` will pick it up automatically.
- **llvm-tools** (for coverage): `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`
- **cargo-llvm-cov** (coverage runner): `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`
- No other system dependencies are required for a development build.

### Build

```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

### Test

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

### Coverage

Coverage gates are enforced in CI and are a hard PR requirement (see below). To check locally:

```sh
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info
cargo llvm-cov report --workspace
```

Gates (from [specs/01-architecture.md](specs/01-architecture.md) §7):

- **≥ 80%** line coverage for critical functions — search orchestration, fusion, chunking,
  extraction normalization, config resolution, ID derivation.
- **≥ 90%** for anything that **modifies data** — store upserts/deletes, index job execution,
  document/chunk writes, config/state mutation, migrations, the write-lock path.

A PR that drops below either gate will not be merged.

### Lint + format

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Both must be clean before a PR is opened. CI enforces this with `--deny warnings`.

Markdown prose wraps at 100 columns, enforced by Qlty Cloud on PRs and auto-fixed by
[the qlty CLI](https://qlty.sh) (`qlty fmt --all`, config in `.qlty/qlty.toml` + `.prettierrc`). To
have staged Markdown formatted automatically on commit, opt in once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook is non-blocking: it does nothing if `qlty` is not installed and never rejects a commit.

## Spec-first rule

> **Any behavior change or new feature must start with a spec edit in the same PR.**

`specs/` is the design authority. Code is the implementation of the spec; if they diverge the spec
is consulted to decide what is correct. Steps for a change that touches behavior:

1. Edit the relevant spec section (or add a new section) in `specs/`.
2. Write the failing test that proves the new or changed behavior.
3. Implement until the test passes and coverage gates are met.
4. Update user-facing docs if the surface changes.

Pull requests that add or change behavior without a corresponding spec edit will be sent back to
update the spec first.

---

## Test-driven development (TDD)

TDD is the default mode for all crates (see [specs/01-architecture.md](specs/01-architecture.md)
§7):

1. Write the **failing test** first.
2. Write the minimum implementation to make it pass.
3. Refactor under green.

Trait-based seams (`RetrievalStore`, `Embedder`) exist to make this practical: core logic is tested
against in-memory fakes; adapter crates are tested against the real backend (LanceDB in a `tempdir`,
ONNX tiny model) in integration tests. Do not merge tests that pass trivially or mock away the
behavior under test.

Coverage gates (stated above) are a **PR requirement**, not a guideline.

## Commit style

Commits in this repository follow a short imperative-mood subject line, no ticket prefix required,
body optional. Examples drawn from the log:

```
Wire serve and mcp subcommands to their crate implementations
T09 review: strengthen test coverage — full error exit code map, real store list shape test
Fix all spec violations, unmet ACs, and fake tests
```

- One logical change per commit.
- Subject line ≤ 72 characters.
- Reference spec sections in the body when the commit implements spec behavior.

---

## Proposing features

Anything that touches spec-defined behavior (a new command flag, a new API endpoint, a new chunking
preset, a change to error codes, a new roadmap phase) requires an issue **before** you open a PR.

1. Check [specs/06-roadmap.md](specs/06-roadmap.md) — the item may already be planned or explicitly
   deferred. If it is explicitly deferred, explain in your issue why the deferral reasoning no
   longer applies.
2. Open an issue using the [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) template.
3. Wait for acknowledgment before writing code.

Small bug fixes, test improvements, and documentation corrections do not need a prior issue.

## AI-assisted development

This project uses Claude Code as a development assistant. Conventions for working in this repository
(worktree layout, agent ground rules, spec-first enforcement) are documented in `CLAUDE.md` at the
repo root. If `CLAUDE.md` does not yet exist, the conventions in this file apply.
