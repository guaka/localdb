//! Retry policy and transient-failure classification for outbound HTTP
//! requests (issue #207).
//!
//! Two things live here, and they are independent knobs:
//!
//!   - [`retry_policy`] builds the `backon` schedule (how many attempts, how
//!     long between them).
//!   - [`is_transient`] decides which *outcomes* are worth feeding to that
//!     schedule at all. A 404 is not retried no matter how generous the
//!     schedule is; a 429 is retried even on the very first attempt.
//!
//! # The shape a caller (the fetch loop) should use
//!
//! Drive the retry loop with a closure returning
//! `Result<localdb_core::ingestion::FetchResult, RetryError>` — reusing
//! `FetchResult` directly rather than inventing a parallel outcome type. Its
//! four variants already are exactly the four terminal, non-retryable
//! results a single attempt can produce:
//!
//!   - `Ok(FetchResult::Downloaded { .. })` — success; stop.
//!   - `Ok(FetchResult::NotModified)` — 304; stop (never retried).
//!   - `Ok(FetchResult::Gone)` — 404/410; stop (never retried).
//!   - `Ok(FetchResult::Blocked)` — the SSRF guard refused the destination,
//!     either at the preflight check or by [`is_blocked_error`] recovering it
//!     from a failed `send()`; stop (never retried, regardless of what
//!     [`is_transient`] would say about the underlying network error — the
//!     closure should recognize this case and return `Ok(Blocked)` rather
//!     than `Err(RetryError::Request(..))` in the first place, exactly as
//!     today's `HttpUrlFetcher::fetch` already does before this module
//!     existed).
//!
//! Every other case — a retryable-*candidate* status (429/408/5xx) or a
//! `send()` failure that was not a blocked destination — is `Err`:
//!
//!   - `Err(RetryError::Status { status, retry_after })` for a non-2xx/304
//!     response the closure decided is not `Gone`.
//!   - `Err(RetryError::Request(reqwest::Error))` for a failed `send()` that
//!     [`destination::is_blocked_error`] did *not* recognize.
//!
//! `backon`'s `.when(is_transient)` then decides whether that `Err` is worth
//! retrying; a fatal status (400, 403, ...) or a non-timeout/connect network
//! error reaches `.when()`, is classified `false`, and the loop returns it
//! immediately as the final error for the caller to translate into
//! `Error::ProviderUnavailable`.
//!

/// retries), not 3, that each pay the 30 s per-attempt timeout (see
/// [`retry_policy`]'s own doc comment on `with_max_times`).
///
/// `HttpUrlFetcher::fetch` additionally acquires a pacing token per attempt,
/// which adds at most 3 × 1 s at the default 1 req/s — the cooldown half of
/// that wait is not additive, since `note_retry_after` stores an absolute
/// deadline the adjuster has already slept through by the time the next
/// `acquire` runs. ~153 s, which is materially the same bound.
///
/// That 30 s sleep half of the bound is real only because

/// performs. Handing the same number to `backon`'s own `with_total_delay`
/// does not achieve it and is deliberately not done (see [`retry_policy`]):
/// `backon` charges its budget only for the delay *it* proposed for an
/// attempt, never for the value an `.adjust()` closure substitutes in its

/// INLINE_RETRY_AFTER_CAP)` and leaned on `backon`'s accounting therefore let
/// a server responding `Retry-After: 30` blow straight through this budget —
/// `backon` charges each attempt's own (small, exponentially-growing-from-1 s)
/// proposal, sees plenty of apparent headroom, and keeps allowing retries
/// while the loop really sleeps 30 s each time. Three such retries sleep 90 s
/// against a budget `backon` still believes is barely touched, pushing the
/// real worst case to roughly 210 s (the same 4 attempts × 30 s of timeouts =
/// 120 s, plus 90 s of actual sleep instead of the intended 30 s). That was an
/// observed defect on this branch, not a hypothetical, and so was its
/// narrower sibling: an adjuster that tracked honored `Retry-After` values but
/// returned `backon`'s fallback delay *untracked* let a mixed sequence (429
/// with a header, 503 without, …) sleep past the budget through the untracked
/// arm. Both are why the adjuster now charges every delay it returns to one
/// counter. 30 s is generous enough to ride out a short-lived 429 without
/// making the budget dominate. See [`retry_policy`] for why a non-default
/// `min_retry_delay` scales this budget down with it rather than leaving it

/// `HttpSettings::min_retry_delay` to keep wall-clock time down.
///
/// Behavior, in order:
///
/// 1. `dur?` — if `backon` has already decided to stop (its own
///    `max_retries`/`total_delay` accounting exhausted), this closure must
///    never resurrect that decision. Load-bearing, not stylistic: a version
///    of this closure that inspected the error before checking `dur`
///    returned `Some(retry_after)` unconditionally, which resurrects a
///    stopped retry loop on every subsequent poll against a server that
///    keeps sending 429 + `Retry-After` — an infinite loop that was actually
///    observed on this branch, not a hypothetical.
/// 2. No `Retry-After` on this error (a network-error `RetryError::Request`,
///    or a `Status` with no parsed header) → `backon`'s own computed
///    exponential-backoff delay becomes the candidate wait. It is still
///    charged against the budget in point 4 like any other — an earlier
///    version returned it directly, *bypassing* the tracker, which is how a
///    mixed sequence (a 429 carrying a header, then a 503 carrying none, …)
///    could sleep past the budget: every header-less delay was invisible to
///    the only counter that could stop the loop.
/// 3. A `Retry-After` over [`INLINE_RETRY_AFTER_CAP`] → `None`, ending the
///    retry loop immediately rather than clamping it down to the cap and
///    sleeping anyway. Waiting that long inline would eat into (or exceed)
///    `total_budget` on its own; the caller maps the resulting terminal
///    error to `RateLimited`/`RetriesExhausted`. This function has no side
///    channel to record a pacing cooldown from the oversized value itself —
///    a caller that wants that (as `fetch::lib`'s `HttpUrlFetcher::fetch`
///    does, via `HostLimiter::note_retry_after`) must record it from the
///    attempt's own response handling, *before* the `Err` carrying it
///    reaches this closure at all, not from here.
/// 4. Otherwise: honor the candidate wait — whichever of the two branches
///    above produced it — but only if doing so keeps this loop's *actual*
///    cumulative sleep under `total_budget`. This is the **only** cumulative
///    bound on the loop: [`retry_policy`] deliberately does not also set
///    `backon`'s own `with_total_delay`, because this counter sees every
///    delay the loop ever sleeps and `backon`'s sees only the ones it
///    proposed itself, making its cutoff unreachable and its presence purely
///    a second, weaker number to confuse the next reader with. (`max_times`
///    is still `backon`'s — an attempt *count* is a genuinely separate
///    concept from a sleep budget.) Tracked in an `AtomicU64` of
///    milliseconds — an atomic rather than a `Cell`/`RefCell` because the
///    future this closure lives inside is boxed `dyn Future + Send` by
///    `#[async_trait]` on every `Embedder` impl that calls
///    `send_with_retry`, and a `&Cell`/`&RefCell` held across an `.await` is
///    not `Send`, since neither type is `Sync`. The budget check happens
///    *before* adding the candidate sleep to the tracker, and it is a
///    **pre-add** check — `spent_so_far + wait`, not `spent_so_far`
///    alone, is compared against `total_budget`. A post-hoc check (comparing
///    only what was already spent) was tried and rejected: at production
///    settings, where `total_budget` equals [`INLINE_RETRY_AFTER_CAP`]
///    exactly, a single maximal wait happens to consume the whole budget
///    either way, which looks like the two forms "collapse" to the same
///    behavior — but that equivalence only holds for a wait at the cap.
///    For anything smaller — `Retry-After: 29` against a 30 s budget, say —
///    a post-hoc check honors a *second* 29 s wait too (`29 s < 30 s` is
///    still true after the first), sleeping 58 s against a documented 30 s
///    budget. The pre-add form rejects that second wait: `29 s + 29 s = 58
///    s > 30 s budget`. A single honored wait exactly at `total_budget` is
///    still allowed (`0 + total_budget` is not `> total_budget`), so the
