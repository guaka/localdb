//! Shared HTTP client policy: user agent, timeout, retry, and per-host
//! pacing — the pieces that are the same regardless of which destination
//! policy `HttpUrlFetcher` enforces (see `fetch::destination`).
//!
//! Motivation (issue #207): a feed with many entries hosted on the same
//! origin was observed firing on the order of twenty-three requests per
//! second at that origin, which is indistinguishable from a denial-of-service
//! attempt from the far end and earns localdb a 429 (or an IP ban) in
//! response. Two independent mechanisms fix that, and both live here so
//! `fetch::lib`'s `HttpUrlFetcher::fetch` (owned by a later stage) can compose
//! them without re-deriving either:
//!
//!   - [`retry`] classifies which failures are worth retrying at all (a 429
//!     or a transient network error; never a destination the SSRF guard
//!     refused) and how long to back off, honoring a server's own
//!     `Retry-After` guidance where present.
//!   - [`limiter::HostLimiter`] paces *every* request to a host, proactively,
//!     independent of whether any individual request ever fails — this is
//!     what actually stops the 23-requests-per-second pattern, since a token
//!     bucket smooths the burst before the origin ever has cause to reply
//!     with a 429 in the first place.
//!
//! This module intentionally knows nothing about `core`'s YAML config
//! *shape* — only [`HttpSettings`], a plain struct converted from
//! `localdb_core::config::HttpConfig` at the one composition point
//! ([`HttpSettings`]'s `From` impl below). That keeps `fetch` free of
//! config-format concerns (no `serde`/`schemars` derives in this crate) while
//! still letting operators reach every knob here through `config.yaml`.
