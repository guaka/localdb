//! Per-host outbound pacing (issue #207).
//!
//! Motivation, restated from `super`: a feed with many entries on one origin
//! was observed firing ~23 requests/second at it. `retry` only reacts *after*
//! a request has already failed; this module is the proactive half — a token
//! bucket per destination host that smooths bursts before the origin ever has
//! cause to reply with a 429, plus a per-host cooldown that a 429's own
//! `Retry-After` can extend so the *next* request (to the next feed entry on
//! the same host, not just a retry of this one) inherits the back-off too.
//! That inheritance is what actually stops a burst pattern — reactive retry
//! alone only slows down the one request that already got a 429, while every
//! other request already in flight or about to be sent keeps hammering the
//! same host at the same rate.
//!
//! # Host, not registrable domain
//!
//! Keyed on the lowercased hostname string (`Url::host_str`), not the
//! registrable/eTLD+1 domain. There is no `publicsuffix`-style crate in this
//! workspace, and host-keying can only ever be *more* conservative than
//! domain-keying: `a.example.com` and `b.example.com` get independent
//! buckets rather than sharing one, so at worst this paces some hosts more
//! gently than a "true" per-organization limit would. That is the safe
//! direction to be wrong in for a rate limiter.
