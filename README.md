**Point it at your stuff. Search it instantly — from the terminal, or from any AI assistant you
already use.** Notes, specs, PDFs, Word/Excel/PowerPoint docs, EPUBs, bookmarked pages — one
`localdb index` later, hybrid (keyword + semantic) search returns cited, byte-exact excerpts in
milliseconds. One binary, no Python, no Docker, no cloud, no daemon required for search, no API key.
See [how it compares to GPT4All, Khoj, Basic Memory, and others](#comparison-to-other-tools).

The long-horizon goal is larger: a private, trust-weighted alternative to the feed — your knowledge
enriched by what the people you trust have found, with provenance at every hop. The foundation for
that is built in from day one: content-addressed documents, per-chunk provenance, and stores as
first-class shareable units. See [VISION.md](VISION.md).

**Status: v0.1.0 released.** Hybrid search uses real dense embeddings via the default local model
(`pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`, ONNX on CPU by default; CoreML ANE/GPU on Apple Silicon macOS
automatically); the first `localdb index` or `localdb search` downloads ~706 MB from HuggingFace (no
API key required). The HTTP daemon reads from and writes to the same unified database as the CLI,
and ingestion via `POST /v1/jobs` runs the real indexing pipeline through an async job queue with
live SSE progress, cancellation, and a worker pool — it remains experimental, with no auth. See

## Comparison to other tools

localdb is for personal knowledge search from the command line or from an AI assistant, with no
cloud dependency, no daemon required for search, and one binary to install — no Python interpreter,
virtualenv, or Docker Compose stack. It's agent-first rather than chat-first: the CLI and MCP server
are the primary surfaces, validated in practice against Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and
Hermes Agent, using both cloud (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek) and local (Gemma) model providers. It
already indexes more than "your notes": Markdown, plain text, HTML, PDF, Office documents
(DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/XLS/CSV), and EPUB, all extracted in-process — with connectors for Notion, email,
chat, and transcription planned next.

It is deliberately narrow — "do one thing well": a verifiable retrieval primitive (index, search,
cite), not an all-in-one chat app or team platform. That keeps its API stable enough for other
things to be built on top instead of bundled in — a second-brain UI, or an agent's own live
scratchpad search. A knowledge-graph layer, MCP tools for managing sources/stores, and eventually a
web UI are on the roadmap, alongside — much further out — federation: searching datasets shared by
people you trust, larger than any one person could assemble alone. No surveyed competitor addresses
that last one yet. See [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md) for the full survey against eight
adjacent projects, including exactly where localdb is behind (no GUI yet, single-node, read-only
MCP, no knowledge graph — see its "Where localdb is behind" section).

GPT4All is the most common comparison point (and appears effectively stalled — no commits or
releases in 13+ months); Khoj is the most popular actively-maintained self-hosted alternative
(Python, needs `pip`/`uv`/Docker); Basic Memory is the closest architectural peer — native MCP,
local-first, hybrid search — but trades localdb's read-only cited-corpus model for read-write note
editing, and is scoped to Markdown only (no PDF/Office ingestion). Full details, sources, and
caveats (including the `⚠️` partial marks) are in [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md).

## Feature highlights

- **Citeable hybrid search** — BM25 + dense vector (RRF fusion) returning structured `Citation`
  objects: file URI, heading path, exact text snippet, byte span, content hash, per-component
  scores, and full document metadata. Every result is verifiable.
- **Document metadata** — `DocumentMetadata` (Dublin Core: title, creator, date, description, …)
  extracted from frontmatter and carried on every citation, so agents can attribute sources
  properly.
- **Local files, URLs, and feeds** — `localdb source add ~/notes` or
  `localdb source add https://example.com/page`; `--kind feed` for Atom/RSS with per-source refresh
  intervals; incremental re-index skips unchanged content.
- **Embedded-first** — `localdb search` opens the store in-process; nothing needs to be running. The
  MCP server works the same way.
- **MCP server** — `localdb mcp` exposes four read-only tools (`search`, `list_stores`,
  `get_document`, `get_chunks`) to any MCP-capable AI assistant, over stdio or (via `localdb serve`)
  HTTP — including from another machine over Tailscale/LAN. Connect once, search forever.
- **Multiple stores** — each store is isolated. `--store <name>` (repeatable) is a _filter_:
  omitted, `search`/`status`/`store list`/`source list`/`index`/`mcp` span every store. Only
  `source add` (and the `add` alias) narrows by default, to the store named `default` (exit 2 if it
  doesn't exist), because a write has to land in one named place — see
  [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md#global-flags). `localdb mcp --store <name>` limits what an agent can
  reach, which is how you keep a project-bound store project-bound.
- **Context-aware dense search** — the default embedder (`pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`) is a
  late-chunking model from Perplexity AI that encodes each chunk in the context of its full
  document, producing strong retrieval quality. Stored as binary-quantized 128-byte vectors (Hamming
  / IVF_FLAT), keeping index size small and search fast without a GPU. On Apple Silicon macOS, the
  binary runs the model on the Neural Engine / GPU via CoreML automatically — no `--features` flag
  is needed. The default `local` provider auto-selects CoreML at runtime and falls back to ONNX
  (CPU) otherwise; both produce index-interchangeable vectors. The model is a public MIT release, so
  no API key or license click-through is needed. Alternative: any OpenAI-compatible embedding
  endpoint, including local private models via llama.cpp or MLX (Apple Silicon, SSD-backed KV
  cache).
- **libsql backend**: embedded database with DiskANN vector index and FTS5 full-text search, no
  separate server.
- **`--json` everywhere** — machine-readable output on every command.
- **`localdb status`** — shows indexed stores and daemon state at a glance.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install dokterbob/localdb/localdb
```

Prebuilt binaries with shell completions installed for you. To run the HTTP daemon under
`brew services` (optional — every command also works daemonless):

```bash
brew services start localdb
```

### Shell installer

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/releases/latest/download/localdb-installer.sh | sh
```

### From source

Requires a Rust toolchain (**1.88 or later, on every platform** — the `pdf_oxide` PDF parser
declares that floor, and it subsumes the older per-platform split of Linux 1.82 / macOS 1.85).
Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb
cd localdb
cargo install --path localdb
localdb --version
```

On Apple Silicon macOS, CoreML (ANE/GPU) acceleration is built in automatically — no `--features`
flag is needed. The default `local` embedding provider selects CoreML at runtime when available and
falls back to ONNX (CPU) otherwise; indexes built by either backend are queryable by the other.

### Pre-built tarballs

| Linux arm64         | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | ONNX CPU                                             |

Download and install from the [Releases](https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/releases) page:

```bash
# Replace VERSION and PLATFORM with your values from the table above
PLATFORM=aarch64-apple-darwin   # or x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu / aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
curl -L "https://github.com/dokterbob/localdb/releases/latest/download/localdb-${PLATFORM}.tar.xz" \
  | tar -xJ -C /usr/local/bin --strip-components=1 "localdb-${PLATFORM}/localdb"
localdb --version
```

See [docs/release-engineering.md](docs/release-engineering.md) for full pipeline details and how to
cut a release.

## 60-second quickstart

```bash
# 1. Create a store
localdb store add notes

# 2. Add sources — local directories and/or URLs
localdb source add ~/notes --store notes
localdb source add https://example.com/page --store notes   # optional

# 3. Index
localdb index --store notes

# 4. Check what got indexed
localdb status

# 5. Search
localdb search "how does rust handle errors" --store notes
```

Example output from step 5 (paths shown from a scratch run):

```

Add `--json` to get structured `Citation` objects with chunk IDs, document IDs, provenance hashes,
per-component scores, and document `metadata` fields (title, creator, date, etc.):

```bash
localdb search "hybrid search" --store notes --json
```

---

## MCP hookup

```bash
claude mcp add localdb -- localdb mcp
```

This registers `localdb` as a local MCP server over stdio. Four read-only tools are exposed:
`search` (hybrid search returning Citation JSON), `list_stores` (store names, document counts, chunk
counts), `get_document` (full document text and metadata by document ID), and `get_chunks` (a
document's chunks, paginated).

Once connected, any MCP-capable AI assistant can call `search` against your indexed stores and
return cited excerpts with source URI, heading path, and document metadata — grounded in actual
passages from your files.

Running `localdb serve` too? `localdb mcp` detects it automatically and proxies through the daemon
instead of conflicting with it — no need to stop one to use the other. The daemon also serves the
same tools directly over HTTP at `/mcp`, so you can point an MCP client on a different machine (e.g.
over Tailscale) at it too.

See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) for full tool schemas, the HTTP/remote setup, and example calls.

---

## Experimental HTTP daemon

```bash
localdb serve   # binds http://127.0.0.1:7700 by default
```

The daemon exposes the REST API, plus the same MCP tools over HTTP at `/mcp` (see
[MCP hookup](#mcp-hookup) above). Ingestion via `POST /v1/jobs` runs the real indexing pipeline
through an async job queue — a configurable worker pool, live progress over SSE at
`GET /v1/jobs/{id}/events`, and cancellation via `DELETE /v1/jobs/{id}` (`localdb job cancel`);
`localdb index` submits to and attaches to a running daemon automatically. The daemon reads and
writes the same unified database as the CLI, so CLI-indexed data is visible to it. It remains
**experimental** and unauthenticated — anything that can reach the bind address is trusted. See
[docs/http-api.md](docs/http-api.md) for endpoint reference and known limitations.

---

## Schema migrations

`store-libsql` tracks its schema version explicitly (`schema_migrations` table). Opening a store
whose schema is behind, ahead of, or predates this binary's migration framework **refuses** with an
actionable hint (exit 2) instead of silently rebuilding — run one of:

```bash
localdb db status              # current version, pending migrations, history — never refuses
localdb db migrate              # apply pending migrations (confirmation only for a legacy v1-v3 rebuild)
localdb db downgrade [--to N]   # step back using stored down-SQL (always confirms)
localdb db vacuum               # reclaim disk space freed by migrations/deletes (SQLite VACUUM)
```

An older `localdb` binary can still downgrade a store a newer binary migrated forward — every
migration's down-SQL is stored as data in the database itself, not read from compiled code. See
[docs/migrations.md](docs/migrations.md) for the full walkthrough and the migration-authoring guide.

| Search ranking        | Hybrid BM25 + dense (RRF fusion).

| Embedding models      | Downloaded automatically on first `localdb index` or `localdb search` from the public HuggingFace repo `perplexity-ai/pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`. No API key required.                                                                                                                                      |
| Embedding backend     | Default provider `local` runs ONNX on CPU. On Apple Silicon macOS, the macOS binary includes CoreML by default and auto-selects the ANE/GPU backend at runtime, falling back to ONNX otherwise. CoreML/ONNX indexes are interchangeable. Force a backend with `local-coreml` / `local-onnx`.                 |
| HTTP daemon           | Experimental — no auth. Ingestion via POST /v1/jobs runs the real pipeline through an async job queue (configurable worker pool, SSE progress, cancellation); `localdb index` attaches automatically; reads and writes the unified database same as the CLI.                                                 |
| YAML-declared stores  | Appear in `store list` but **cannot be indexed** (`localdb index` only resolves runtime stores). Use `localdb store add` + `localdb source add` instead.                                                                                                                                                     |
| CLI while daemon runs | CLI and daemon can run concurrently. SQLite WAL and busy_timeout serialise concurrent writes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| MCP while daemon runs | `localdb mcp` now detects a running daemon and proxies to its `/mcp` route automatically, rather than conflicting with it. `--store` narrowing is honored in both modes, but since the daemon's `/mcp` is unauthenticated it is a guardrail, not containment — see [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md#store-scoping). |
| MCP over HTTP         | `/mcp` on the daemon snapshots the store list once at startup — a store added later via `/v1/stores` isn't visible over MCP until restart.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Job control           | `localdb job list` / `localdb job cancel <id>` manage a daemon's job queue; daemon-only (exit 5 without one).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Document commands     | `localdb document list [--source ID]` / `localdb document get <id> [--text]` read indexed documents, embedded or daemon-attached.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Shell completions     | `localdb completions <shell>` for bash/zsh/fish/elvish/powershell — pure codegen, works before `init`, never probes the daemon.                                                                                                                                                                              |

Docs sync: the old Known Gaps entries for source path validation and the macOS bundle ID are
resolved in code and reflected in `docs/architecture.md`. `--store` scoping is now consistent across
every subcommand rather than only `search`/`mcp` (#178, #118, #201 — it is a _filter_, so omitting
it spans every store except on `source add`, and the commands that aren't store-scoped reject it
instead of ignoring it), and `get_document`/`get_chunks` accept an optional `store` argument to
disambiguate a document id that exists in more than one store (#144) — see
[specs/05-surfaces.md §2.2](specs/05-surfaces.md#22-store-scope).

Design rationale and planned behavior live in the [specs/](specs/) directory.
