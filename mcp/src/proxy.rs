//! `ProxyHandler` — forwards `tools/list`/`tools/call` to a running daemon's
//! `/mcp` HTTP route (Phase 3 scope, see `lib.rs`'s crate-level doc comment),
//! optionally narrowed to a `--store` scope (specs/05-surfaces.md §4.2.1).
//!
//! Every other `ServerHandler` in this crate (`handler::McpHandler`) is
//! macro-native: `#[tool_router]`/`#[tool_handler]` generates dispatch from
//! typed argument structs it owns ahead of time. `ProxyHandler` cannot be
//! macro-native — it has no argument structs of its own and does not know
//! the upstream's tool set ahead of time (that set is whatever store
//! snapshot the daemon happened to build at its own startup, see
//! `server::mcp_bridge::build_available_stores`'s doc comment) — so it just
//! relays whatever request arrives to the upstream connection. This is the
//! one hand-written `ServerHandler` impl in the migration, deliberately.
//!
//! ## Why scope is enforced on tool *arguments*
//!
//! Unscoped (no `--store`), this really is a verbatim relay and nothing here
//! inspects a request. Scoped, it has to — and the tool arguments are the
//! only channel available. rmcp's `StreamableHttpService` (`http.rs`) takes a
//! synchronous `Fn() -> Result<S, io::Error>` service factory with no access
//! to the HTTP request, so the daemon cannot hand out a per-connection scoped
//! handler however the client asks: not via `/mcp?store=x`, not via a header.
//! But `search.stores`, `get_document.store`, `get_chunks.store`, and
//! `list_documents.store` exist precisely to name stores, and `tools.rs`
//! already honours them — so the scope travels as an argument, per request,
//! instead of per connection.
//!
//! **This is scoping, not a security boundary.** The daemon's `/mcp` is
//! loopback and unauthenticated: anything that can open a socket can bypass
//! `localdb mcp` and talk to the unscoped endpoint directly. It stops an
//! agent from *accidentally* reading another project's docs; it does not
//! contain a hostile one. See specs/05-surfaces.md §4.2.1.
