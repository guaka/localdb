//! Drift detection: hashing a [`Migration`]'s rendered SQL (or a `RustStep`'s
//! `checksum_repr`) so a stored `schema_migrations` row can be compared
//! against what the currently-compiled chain would produce for that version.
//!
//! A mismatch means the binary's notion of what migration N does has changed
//! since it was applied — e.g. someone edited a shipped migration's SQL in
//! place instead of adding a new one. That's a bug in how migrations are
//! authored (chain entries must be treated as immutable once released, like
//! the `baseline` module), and refusing to proceed is safer than silently
//! running against a database that doesn't match the compiled chain.
//!
//! [`verify_checksums`] does three things, not just one:
//! - **Completeness**: a row must *exist* for the baseline and for every
//!   compiled chain migration up to the caller-supplied `up_to` bound (capped
//!   at this binary's `head_version`) — not just for whatever rows happen to
//!   be present. A store that's missing a row (e.g. a fresh create that died
//!   between `create_schema` stamping `user_version` and the seed rows
//!   landing, or tampering) is corrupt bookkeeping, not an empty-but-valid
//!   history.
//! - **Checksum match**: each present row's `checksum` column must match what
//!   [`migration_checksum`] (or [`baseline_checksum`]) produces today.
//! - **Payload integrity**: each present row's `name`, `down_sql`, and
//!   `down_unsupported_reason` must match what the compiled migration would
//!   render, even if its `checksum` column happens to still read correctly —
//!   catching an edit that touched the payload columns but left `checksum`
//!   untouched (or stale-but-accidentally-equal).
