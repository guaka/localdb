//! Schema-migrations framework (issue #127).
//!
//! A migration `chain` is a linear sequence of numbered steps applied on top
//! of a frozen `baseline` schema snapshot. Each [`Migration`] carries both an
//! "up" step (SQL or a Rust callback) and a "down" step, so a database can be
//! moved forward or backward between adjacent versions.
//!
//! This module defines the shared vocabulary (`Migration`, `Up`, `Down`,
//! `RustStep`, `MigrationContext`), the frozen baseline, the (for now empty)
//! real chain, the `schema_migrations` bookkeeping table (`table`), and the
//! checksum machinery that detects drift (`checksum`). `runner` walks the
//! chain forward one step at a time; `migrate` and `downgrade` are the
//! caller-facing entry points `db migrate` / `db downgrade` / `db status`
//! use, each opening its own store via `maintenance::open_for_maintenance`.

/// # Authoring rules

/// - A `RustStep` runs inside **one transaction owned by the runner**. It
///   must not begin, commit, or roll back its own transaction — the runner
///   does that around the whole migration (and, where multiple migrations
///   are batched, potentially around several).
/// - Because only DB effects roll back on failure, a step must have **no
///   filesystem or network side effects**. Anything it does must be
///   undoable by the transaction rollback alone.
/// - A step must **not call the ingestion/reindex pipeline** — the embedder
///   and extractors live above `store-libsql` (see `specs/01-architecture.md
///   §1`: no domain logic in surface crates, and conversely no reaching
///   *up* out of this crate into them either). If a schema change makes
///   existing derived data (chunks, embeddings) stale, the step must instead
///   mark that staleness transactionally — e.g. bump `policy_version` /
///   `extractor_version`, truncate the now-invalid derived rows — and let a
///   subsequent `localdb index` do the actual re-embedding/re-extraction
///   work.
