//! Single libsql database over the unified schema, split into a writer/reader
//! connection pool.
//!
//! One dedicated **writer** connection is held behind a `tokio::sync::Mutex`:
//! all mutating access goes through it, either directly (via `writer()`) or
//! transactionally (via `write_tx()`, which returns a
//! [`WriteTx`] wrapping a `libsql::Transaction`). Every fallible call site
//! commits/rolls back a `WriteTx` explicitly rather than relying on `Drop` as
//! the primary path: explicit `commit()`/`rollback()` return a `Result` we
//! can log and act on, whereas `WriteTx`'s `Drop`-rollback (a backstop for
//! panics/task aborts only) panics if its rollback fails. See `WriteTx`'s doc
//! comment for a caveat this doesn't fully eliminate — even the explicit
//! path can still panic, in the same narrow case Drop would panic on too.
//!
//! Alongside the writer sits a small pool of independent, read-only **reader**
//! connections (`PRAGMA query_only=ON`), handed out round-robin by
//! `reader()`. Readers never take the writer mutex, so they can't block on or
//! be blocked by a write transaction; they simply see whatever's already
//! committed (or, mid-write, whatever WAL readers always see).
//!
//! Cross-process serialisation is still SQLite's job: WAL admits one writer
//! at a time per file, `busy_timeout=5000` makes contenders wait, and an
//! exhausted busy-timeout maps to the existing `Error::RuntimeStateLocked`
//! (exit 4). There is no advisory file lock — see proposal §3 (Decision 3).
