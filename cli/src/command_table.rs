//! Declarative command table (issue #187 stage 5).
//!
//! Every command that has both an embedded and a daemon-routed
//! implementation drifted, one command at a time, because each hand-rolled
//! its own probe -> branch -> render sequence (issue #187 §3). This module
//! replaces that pattern with one trait, [`DaemonAwareCommand`], and one
//! function, [`dispatch`], that is the *only* place a command's transport is
//! chosen.
//!
//! The invariant this buys: a command has exactly one [`DaemonAwareCommand::Outcome`]
//! type. `run_daemon` and `run_embedded` each build one from their own
//! transport, but neither prints anything — printing happens once, at the
//! call site, from whichever `Outcome` `dispatch` returned. There is
//! structurally no way for the daemon branch to render something the
//! embedded branch wouldn't, because rendering isn't part of either branch.
//!
//! `SCOPE_POLICY` exists for the same reason: several commands resolve a
//! `--store` scope (via `resolve_store_scope`/`resolve_daemon_store_scope`)
//! inside both `run_daemon` and `run_embedded`, and those two resolutions
//! must apply the *same* policy or an omitted `--store` could mean "every
//! store" under one transport and "exit 2, no stores" under the other. A
//! single associated constant, consulted by both methods, makes that
//! agreement structural rather than something a future edit could silently
//! break in only one branch.
