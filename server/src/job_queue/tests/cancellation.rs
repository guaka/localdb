//! Job cancellation (issue #218): `JobQueue::cancel` triggers a per-job
//! `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` that `run_worker` races the job's
//! future against in one `tokio::select!` — no fifth `IndexJobState`
//! variant; a cancelled job is recorded as `Failed` with
//! `error_code: "job_cancelled"` (`localdb_core::Error::JobCancelled`),
//! exactly like any other typed job failure (see `submit.rs`'s
//! `job_failure_with_a_typed_error_carries_its_stable_code_in_error_code`).
//!
//! Every test here is deterministic: no test waits on a fixed sleep to prove
//! cancellation happened — either the job is driven to a terminal state via
//! `wait_for_done`'s bounded poll (a safety-net deadline, not a timing
//! assertion), or a task body is parked on a gate this test alone controls
//! (a `oneshot` it either never sends, or sends only after asserting on the
//! cancelled outcome).
