//! Bounded terminal-job retention: the registry evicts the oldest
//! `Done`/`Failed` jobs once their
//! count exceeds a cap, so a long-running daemon's job history doesn't grow
//! without bound.
//!
//! The pure eviction function (`evict_oldest_terminal_jobs_over_cap`) is
//! tested directly against hand-built registries below, with small,
//! test-chosen `cap`/`cutoff` values — not the real `MAX_TERMINAL_JOBS`
//! (200) or a real minute-long grace wait; hand-built fixtures with
//! explicit `completed_at` strings make ordering, grace, and protection
//! each provable in isolation. The one real end-to-end test below (through
//! `JobQueue::submit` at the real constants) pins the production-wired
//! consequence of the retention grace: a burst of
//! fresh completions past the cap evicts *nothing*, so a submitter's first
//! post-submit attach/poll can never 404.
//!
//! `PROTECT_NONE` below: the pure tests that aren't about the
//! self-protection rule pass an id that matches nothing in their fixture,
//! so protection is inert and the test exercises only the ordering/cap
//! logic. The self-protection rule has its own dedicated test; same idea
//! for `CUTOFF_EVICT_ALL` and the grace rule.
