//! Async job queue for indexing work.
//!
//! Accepts `IndexJob` submissions, executes them via the ingestion pipeline,
//! and tracks state/stats so HTTP callers can poll `GET /jobs/{id}`.
//!
//! Jobs are queued via a tokio channel and executed by a pool of background
//! worker tasks (issue #208, `server.job_workers` config key; defaults to
//! 1, matching the historical single-worker behavior) — see
//! `JobQueue::with_workers` and `run_worker`. All workers share the one
//! channel receiver, so jobs for *different* stores can run concurrently
//! across workers; jobs for the *same* store stay serialized regardless of
//! worker count, via the per-store in-flight guard below. The work itself
//! is an async future (`server::job_exec::run_job` in production) —
//! the worker `tokio::spawn`s it and awaits the `JoinHandle`, rather than
//! `spawn_blocking`: the ingestion pipeline does its own blocking dispatch
//! for CPU-bound work internally (`core::blocking::run_blocking`, which
//! uses `tokio::task::block_in_place` on a multi-thread runtime — see
//! specs/01-architecture.md §6), so the queue itself stays on the async
//! runtime.
//!
//! A per-store in-flight guard (`inflight`) rejects a second submission for a
//! store that already has a job queued or running, at submit time, with
//! `Error::IndexInProgress` — before real ingestion, two concurrent jobs
//! against the same store could race on the same `DocumentIndex`/store
//! handle.
//!
//! Cancellation (issue #218) latency: `run_worker` races a running job's
//! future against its `CancellationToken` in one `tokio::select!`, which
//! only gets a chance to observe the token when the task future actually
//! yields control back to the executor — an `.await` on another task, an
//! I/O readiness wait, a timer. `block_in_place` does NOT yield: it blocks
//! the current worker thread until the closure returns, so a cancellation
//! requested mid-parse or mid-embedding-batch does not take effect until
//! that CPU-bound operation finishes on its own. See `run_worker`'s
//! `select!` for where this matters in practice.
//!
//! Panic isolation (issue #208 review, concurrency-breaker finding): a
//! panic *inside* a job's future is already caught by `tokio::spawn` and
//! surfaces as a normal `JoinError`-backed failure. `process_job` also
//! wraps the one *synchronous*, caller-supplied panic seam — building
//! that future by calling `(queued.task)()` — in `std::panic::catch_unwind`,
//! converting a panic there into the same kind of recorded job failure
//! rather than letting it unwind out of the worker task. With a pool of
//! `N` workers (rather than one), an unguarded panic there would both
//! strand the job `Running` forever (its in-flight guard and progress
//! channel never released — permanent `IndexInProgress` for that store)
//! *and* silently shrink the pool to `N-1`, since nothing respawns a
//! worker task that unwinds away. See `process_job`'s doc comment.
//!
//! Pending-cancel atomicity: `process_job`'s
//! check of `cancel_token.is_cancelled()` and its resulting registry write
//! (either straight to `Failed`/`job_cancelled`, or to `Running`) happen
//! inside the *same* `registry.write().await` critical section that
//! `JobQueue::cancel` holds across its own check-and-trigger. Sharing that
//! lock is what makes the two mutually exclusive, so a `cancel()` call that
//! observes a job `Pending` and triggers its token can never lose a race
//! against this worker having already decided (moments earlier, under a
//! then-separate lock) to start it anyway. See `cancel`'s and
//! `process_job`'s doc comments for the full reasoning.
//!
//! Publication order: `submit`
//! installs a job's `JobHandle` (its cancel token and progress channel)
//! *before* inserting the job into the registry, not after. A job is never
//! visible to `list_jobs`/`get_job` (so, `GET /v1/jobs`/`GET /jobs/{id}`)
//! until its handle already exists — closing a window where a client that
//! saw a job that way and cancelled it immediately could find a
//! non-terminal registry entry but no handle yet, and `cancel` would
//! silently report success without ever triggering anything. See `submit`'s
//! and `cancel`'s doc comments.
//!
//! Bounded terminal-job retention: the registry evicts the oldest
//! `Done`/`Failed` jobs once their
//! count exceeds [`MAX_TERMINAL_JOBS`], so a long-running daemon's job
//! history doesn't grow without bound — except jobs terminal for less than
//! [`TERMINAL_RETENTION_GRACE_SECS`], which are never evicted (covering a
//! submitter's first post-submit attach/poll).
//! See `evict_oldest_terminal_jobs_over_cap`.
