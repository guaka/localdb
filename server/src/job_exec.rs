//! Real ingestion engine for daemon-submitted jobs (issue #187 §1).
//!
//! Before this module existed, `POST /v1/jobs` and the URL refresh scheduler
//! both submitted a stub closure that returned `IndexJobStats::default()`
//! without ever running ingestion — a job would go `Pending -> Running ->
//! Completed` reporting all-zero stats while nothing was actually indexed.
//! `run_job` is a faithful port of what was originally the CLI's own
//! embedded composition loop (`run_embedded_index_with`) so the daemon does
//! the same real work the CLI does when running embedded, just scoped to a
//! single job invocation rather than a whole CLI process's store loop. As of
//! issue #187 stage 3, the CLI's embedded `index`/`source add` paths run
//! through this exact function too (via a local `JobQueue`,
//! `cli/src/job_attach.rs`) rather than a separate copy — `run_job` is now
//! the one engine both surfaces share.
//!
//! Error handling follows specs §5's WARN-per-file rule: a per-source
//! failure increments `IndexJobStats::error_count` and is logged via
//! `tracing::warn!`, never aborting the run. Only a failure that prevents
//! the whole job from proceeding at all (cannot list sources, cannot build
//! the embedder, cannot open the store handle, an unresolvable job scope)
//! returns `Err` — the caller fails the job honestly instead of reporting
//! fabricated success.
//!
//! HTTP fetcher-pair sharing (issue #208 PR #227 review): `run_job` itself
//! stays agnostic to *how* it got a fetcher pair — see
//! [`JobExecDeps::fetchers`]. The daemon (`server::state::AppState::run_scoped_job`)
//! passes a pair reused across jobs via `AppState::get_or_build_fetchers`,
//! so per-host pacing (issue #207) holds across concurrent
//! `server.job_workers` jobs rather than each getting its own
//! `HostLimiter`. The CLI's embedded path always passes `None` (a single
//! job at a time — nothing to share), which falls back to building a fresh
//! pair right here, unchanged from before this field existed.
