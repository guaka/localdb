# CLAUDE.md — localdb contributor reference

## Build / Test / Lint

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p localdb-core          # single crate
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info
cargo llvm-cov report --summary-only
qlty fmt --all        # wrap Markdown prose at 100 cols (qlty CLI, optional locally)
```

All the cargo commands run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); `qlty fmt` is local-only.
`cargo llvm-cov` requires the `llvm-tools-preview` component and `cargo-llvm-cov` installed.

**The toolchain is pinned** in `rust-toolchain.toml`, so local lints match CI's exactly — a new
stable release cannot turn every open PR red on its own. New lints arrive by bumping `channel`
there, deliberately, in one PR. Run `cargo --version` and check it against `channel`: a `cargo`
installed by anything other than rustup (Homebrew's `rust` formula, a distro package) ignores the
pin, and you will lint against a different compiler than CI does. Note this is **not** the MSRV —
that is `Cargo.toml`'s `rust-version`, and it moves separately.

**Coverage gates:** workspace line coverage must be ≥ 80%; data-modifying paths must be ≥ 90%.
Design rationale and enforcement detail: `specs/01-architecture.md §7`. Default workflow is **TDD**
— write the failing test first.

**Reclaim disk under pressure:** these caches are regenerable — delete them instead of
`cargo clean`, which also wipes the dependency cache and costs a full rebuild (~15 min for this
workspace):

- `rm -rf target/debug/incremental` — incremental compilation cache; safe to delete any time.
- `rm -rf target/llvm-cov-target` — `cargo llvm-cov`'s separate instrumented build tree; delete
  after a coverage run.

## Crate map

Directories are short, **package names are prefixed**: `cargo -p` uses `localdb-<dir>`
(`-p localdb-cli`, `-p localdb-embed`, …; the binary is `-p localdb`). Each crate pins `[lib] name`
to the short directory name, so imports in code stay unprefixed (`use extract::…`).

**Design authority is `specs/`** — read the relevant spec before changing behavior; fix the spec
first if it is wrong.

## Conventions

- **No domain logic in surface crates** (`cli`, `mcp`, `server`) — see
  `specs/01-architecture.md §1`.
- **Exit codes are stable API**: 0 ok, 1 internal, 2 invalid usage/config, 3 not found, 4
  conflict/locked, 5 unavailable — see `specs/05-surfaces.md §5`. Do not add new codes without a
  spec change.
- **Async**: the project's async model is documented in `specs/01-architecture.md §6` — follow it
  for all new async code.
- **CLI uses real embeddings via config policy**: `cli` calls `embed::create_embedder` from the
  config; `FakeEmbedder` is only used in unit tests. The default embedder is `provider: local`
  (auto), `model: pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` — a context-aware late-chunking model (MIT-licensed,
  public HuggingFace repo `perplexity-ai/pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b`). On macOS the `local` provider
  auto-selects CoreML (ANE/GPU) automatically — the macOS binary enables `embed`'s `local-coreml`
  feature by default via `cli/Cargo.toml`'s `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]`, so
  no `--features` flag is needed. It falls back to ONNX otherwise; CoreML/ONNX vectors are
  index-interchangeable (force a backend with `local-coreml` / `local-onnx`). The first
  `localdb index` or `localdb search` triggers a one-time ~706 MB download; no API key or license
  click-through is required. Alternative local model: `model: bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim, much
  smaller). Hosted alternatives: `provider: perplexity` with `model: pplx-embed-context-v1`
  (requires API key), or `provider: openai-compatible`.
- **ONNX Runtime is loaded dynamically, never statically linked** (issue #133): `embed`'s `ort`
  dependency uses `load-dynamic`, and `embed/build.rs` embeds Microsoft's _official_ ONNX Runtime
  build (pinned version, sha256-verified) for every `local-onnx` target — Linux x64, Linux aarch64,
  and macOS aarch64 alike. `embed::ort_runtime::ensure_ort_initialized` extracts it to the user's
  cache dir and calls `ort::init_from` before any other `ort` API is touched. Never re-enable
  `ort`'s `download-binaries` or any `api-*` default feature (`embed/Cargo.toml` pins
  `default-features = false` deliberately) — `download-binaries` reintroduces pyke.io's prebuilt
  archive, which gave release binaries a `GLIBC_2.38` floor and broke startup on glibc-2.35 distros
  (Mint 21, Ubuntu 22.04); see `docs/architecture.md` §"ONNX Runtime loading" and `pykeio/ort#523`.
- **HTTP daemon is experimental**: reads (`/v1/search`, `/v1/documents/{id}`, `/v1/status`) DO see
  CLI-indexed data — the daemon opens the same unified `localdb.db` as the CLI, not an in-memory
  store, and there is no separate write-lock (SQLite WAL + `busy_timeout=5000` serialise concurrent
  writers). `POST /v1/jobs` (ingestion) runs the real pipeline (`server/src/job_exec.rs`) through an
  async job queue with a configurable worker pool (`server.job_workers`, default 1, issue #208) and
  a per-store in-flight guard (issue #187) — a duplicate submission for a store already running gets
  `index_in_progress`, HTTP 409 / CLI exit 4, regardless of worker count; jobs for different stores
  run concurrently up to `server.job_workers` workers, but same-store jobs are always serialized.
  `localdb index` submits a job to the daemon and attaches to its live progress via SSE
  (`GET /v1/jobs/{id}/events`, issue #83, falling back to polling), rendering an identical
  summary/`--json`/`--strict` to embedded mode; `--delete` works daemon-attached too. **Stopping the
  daemon before running `localdb index` is no longer required.** Still experimental as a surface —
  no auth. See `specs/05-surfaces.md §2-3` and `docs/architecture.md#known-gaps`.
- **Schema changes require a chain entry AND a `create_schema` fold-in**: every migration is written
  twice — once in `store-libsql/src/migrations/chain.rs`'s `migrations()`, once folded into
  `schema::create_schema` — the drift-guard test
  (`drift_guard_create_schema_equals_baseline_plus_chain`) fails otherwise. Migrations are explicit:
  `localdb db migrate` applies them; `open` never migrates on any surface. See `docs/migrations.md`.
- **Config schema changes require doc comments + template + regenerated artifact**:
  `core/src/config/jsonschema.rs`'s generated schema descriptions come straight from `RawConfig`
  (and its nested types') doc comments, so a new/changed config property needs its doc comment
  updated, needs mentioning in `core/src/config/config.template.yaml` (a test asserts every schema
  property appears there, live or commented-out), and needs the committed
  `schema/config.schema.json` artifact regenerated via
  `cargo run -p localdb -- internal print-schema > schema/config.schema.json` — the drift-guard test
  (`core/tests/config_schema_drift.rs`) fails otherwise. See `specs/03-config.md` §8.
- **Outgoing HTTP goes through `fetch::http`, never a bare `reqwest::Client`** (issue #207): retry
  (429/408/5xx/timeout, honoring `Retry-After`, capped at 30s inline / 30s cumulative budget per
  document) and per-host pacing (`governor`, default 1 req/s burst 4, loopback/LAN exempt) live once
  in `fetch` and are shared by `fetch` itself and by `embed`'s hosted providers (reactive-only there
  — no proactive pacing against paid APIs). Configured via the top-level `http:` config section,
  deliberately outside `defaults.indexing` so it never affects `policy_version`. See
  `specs/03-config.md §1-2` and `specs/01-architecture.md §1`.

- **`[workspace.package].version` is release-plz-owned — never hand-bump it**: release-plz maintains
  a rolling release PR (version bump + CHANGELOG.md via `cliff.toml`); merging that PR tags
  `vX.Y.Z`, which triggers the dist release pipeline. All crates inherit the workspace version and
  bump in lockstep under one bare `vX.Y.Z` tag (created only for the `localdb` package); internal
  path deps carry a `version = "X.Y.Z"` requirement that release-plz keeps in sync on each bump
  (`cargo package` requires one — see `docs/release-engineering.md`).

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` is generated — never hand-edit it**: edit `dist-workspace.toml`
  and rerun `dist generate`; `dist generate --check` and the workflow-shape tests in
  `localdb/tests/packaging.rs` guard the wiring. The custom jobs live in hand-maintained
  `workflow_call` workflows (`release-checks.yml`, `homebrew-tap-publish.yml`, `smoke-test.yml`);
  `release-plz.yml` feeds the tags.

## Commit style

Ticket branches use a `TXX:` prefix (e.g. `T12: add packaging & release workflow`). Review commits
on ticket branches use `TXX review: …`. Merge commits: `Merge ticket/tXX (wave N)`. Plain imperative
for standalone fixes (e.g. `Wire serve and mcp subcommands to their crate implementations`).
